            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT <hi>Mr</hi> Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <note place="margin">In Epiſt.</note> who <hi>undertakes to vindicate the reaſon of Popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and I who have profeſſed my ſelfe a Friend to Monarchy, ſhould from the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſame Naturall Cauſes, and of the ſame Actions in Hiſtorie, forme different Judgements, is no more a wonder then that two Men viewing the ſame Object by various lights, ſhould judge it to be of various Colours. But it ſeems a little ſtrange that even in ſuch things where We both make uſe of the ſame light, and where it is my interest to be of his Opinion, our
<pb facs="tcp:43887:6"/> Jugements ſhould not be reconcileable. I ſpeak this in reference to the Apologie He makes for Private Mens dealing in State Affaires, and obtruding Models of Government upon the World, or teaching new arts of Policy to thoſe Men whoſe Experience has rendred them Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of that Trade: Which though I alwaies reputed a great Vanity, I conclude more blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſince I have ſeen the Excuſes he is able to make for it. For though it is not to be denied that <hi>Ariſtotle, Machiavel,</hi> and <hi>Sr Thomas More</hi> are great Perſons, and may by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority give Protection to any man who is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into their Train, yet the Question ſtill remains, Whether this Privilege can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to every little Writer that puts himſelf into their Livery. The workes of thoſe Perſons have met with an applauſe in the World equall to their merit, becauſe keeping themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in generall Terms, The have preſerved the Freedome of Philoſophers; Or if at any time They have deſcended to particulars, it has been without any reflection upon a particular Time or Place; This can be no justification to a Book which profeſſes to have nothing of <hi>Fiction</hi> or <hi>Romance,</hi> but to be adapted to the Occaſions or Neceſſities of a particular Juncture, And is not propoſed with the Temper and Moderation becoming a Philoſophicall Opinion, but with the heat and paſſion belonging to a Deſign. Which way of writing has no more affinity with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then a Libell has with a ſerious Tract, or a

                  </gap>ies</hi> may perhaps believe alſo that <hi>Mr Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> may frame a good Commonwealth without any Experience in State Affaires; But they who understand that <hi>Columbus</hi> must first have been at the <hi>Indies</hi> before he could make a Card to teach other Men the way thither, will goe neere to ſuſpect <hi>Mr Harrington's</hi> Abilities in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delling a Commonwealth, till he has ſpent ſome yeares in the Ministry of State. I must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acknowledge that I doe not lay claim to Pardon for having thrust my ſelf into a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute of Government, by any part of the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie <hi>Mr Harrington</hi> has made for it: But I do not deſpaire of doing it by repreſenting, That what I have ſaid is all by way of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Poſition, without any private Aime or Deſign; That I was not without reluctancy at first drawn to it by the Authority of ſome Friends, from whom <hi>Mr Harrington</hi> did by all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Importunity endeavour to extort ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of Objection; That afterward I was willing to preſerve the Freedome of my own and other Mens Opinions, and not ſuffer that They who pretend ſo much to Liberty, ſhould with inſupportable Tyranny bring a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very upon our Diſcourſe and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>I wiſh that this could have been effected by ſome other Method then by managing a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; For that way of writing has a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:43887:7"/> of ill Nature upon it, and looks more like an improvement of Contention, then an inquiry into Truth. It is by a very happy Metaphore called drawing the Saw, For the Noiſe We make teares the Eares of ſuch as ſtand by, And the Dust We raiſe puts out their Eies. Beſides when one Book is ſhackled to another (like Spaniels in Couples) It is impoſſible by ranging to ſpring new Matter, or to give the Reader any thing of Delight or Diverſion.</p>
            <p>But I am more then ordinarily unfortunate by having to deale with an Adverſary who mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies upon Me all the inconveniencies of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, by having baniſhed from it that Calmneſs of which it is Capable, and that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity with which it ought to be managed; For to ſpeak modestly, <hi>Mr Harrington's</hi> Arguments are not alwaies Demonſtrations nor his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions Complements. But for my part I intend not to enter into Competition with him for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either an able Sophiſter or Calumniator; but I will preſerve that Temper which belongs to a Man who diſliking Paſſion in other People, ought to detest it in himſelf; And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his provocations, I will more conſider what it is fit for Me to ſpeake then Him to heare. In my preſent Anſwer to his Reply to the Conſiderations on <hi>Oceana,</hi> I have not been cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of any other Method then his own, but have made twelve Chapters confronting his, in diſcuſsion of the twelve Queſtions he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; And in the Margin I have by the
<pb facs="tcp:43887:7"/> leter H. cited ſuch Paſſages of his Book to which my Anſwers are particularly applyed.</p>
            <p>To confeſs a ſecret, I am ſo much gratifyed by ſomething in <hi>Mr Harrington's</hi> Booke, that I know not how to be offended with Him. In ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places he inſinuates as if the Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on his Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana</hi> were not my own, but had been compoſed by the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi> or at leaſt by ſome eminent Perſons in it: This is beyond meaſure obliging, For with thoſe men who are perſuaded by him that the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations had not much of ſence in them, the Diſcned it ſlides off from me upon other People; But if any man ſhall ſtill retain a good Opinion of that Pamphlet, It muſt need be infinitely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by the thought, That ſo renowned an <hi>Univerſity</hi> ſhould in any meaſure concur to it.</p>
            <p>Yet I could have been well contented He would have afforded me his Belief, when I aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him I had no relation to the <hi>Univerſity:</hi> That would I am ſure have ſaved him a great deale of unneceſſary Paines, And He ſhould not need ſo vainly to have purſued Me through the various ſhapes of a Divine, a Doctor, an Head of a Colledg, a Profeſſor, a Prevaricator, a Mathematician. He might alſo by that have concealed the Pique He has ſo unjuſtly taken up againſt <hi>Univerſities</hi> and Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and ſome particular perſons who have an intereſt in both. One paſſage of his referring to this Head, is a little leſs intelligible then ſo fine a piece ought to be, and therefore I will
<pb facs="tcp:43887:8"/> do Him and the World the right to make a ſhort Comment vpon it. He has ſaid in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

We are then to underſtand That a Gentleman in the <hi>Univerſity</hi> who is both a Divine, a Doctor, an head of a College, and a Mathematician, has the Satisfaction to ſee frequently at his Lodging an aſſembly of Men who are known both at home and abroad to be of the most learned perſons of this Age; The imployment of this Company is by making Experiments and by communicating their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations to carry on a diſcovery of Nature, in order to which They have ſometimes had occaſion to inquire, by the help of a Microſcope, into the Figure and poſition of thoſe ſmaller parts of which all Bodies are compoſed; At other times applying the Microſcope to ſome little Animals, as a Flea, a Louſe, or a Mite, They have been convinced that the Fabrik of
<pb facs="tcp:43887:8"/> them is Artificiall to wonder, and that the Wiſedome of the great Architect of Nature is not more conſpicuous in the larger Bulks of an Elephant or Camel, then in theſe little Creatures.

               <p>Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> at the very beginning of his Common-wealth of Oceana, had laid downe a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Government (pretended to be taken out of Giannotti) into Antient and Moderne Prudence, the Antient unanimouſly followed by the Greeks and Romans ending with Caeſar, the Moderne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the Barbarous Nations: Now know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Antiquity is conſidered with Veneration by almoſt all Men, and that even They who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to ſlight it, make great Advantage of it when they imagine it is on their ſide, He intitles to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Prudence that way of Popular Government which his Book applauds, and faſtens upon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Prudence that Monarchicall Government which it Decries. And that He is not wronged by <note place="margin">Oceana p. 2.</note> this Interpretation of his Deſigne, appeares mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly by his ſubſequent Definitions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Againſt this Partition of Prudence into Antient and Modern, and the Application of it that way, the Author of the Conſiderations ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced theſe objections.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That though the Greeks and Romans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed all the World but themſelves, We had no Reaſon to do ſo, it being in them no better then Pride, Pedantry, and ſlavery to narrow thoughts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Examples of the Aſſyrian, Perſian, and Egyptian Monarchies would not conſiſt with this Diviſion, all of which were more antient then the Greeks and Romans.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43887:10"/>3. That Macedon one of the Nobleſt parts of Greece it ſelfe, had alwaies been under the Power of Monarchs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That in the reſt of Greece Regall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was more Antient then Popular; for which (to avoid the uſeleſſe Prolixity of particular Proofs, which are almoſt infinite) one Generall Authority was produced out of Thucydides.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That in Rome alſo Popular Government muſt give the precedence of Time to Monarchy.</p>
               <p>He that after all this, will maintaine Prudence to have been well diſtinguiſht into Antient &amp; Modern, and that by Antient Prudence is to be underſtood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Policy of a Common-wealth, gives us great Occaſion to expect from him Evident and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Anſwers to every one of theſe Objections.</p>
               <p>But to the firſt of them Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Anſwer (when all the Foame is wiped away) comes only to this, that the Greeks and Romans who were <note place="margin">H. p. 57</note> ſuch Jealous Conſervators of Liberty, and Maſters of ſuch excellent parts of knowledge can not with any Truth or Sence be charged with Pedantry, or ſlavery to narrow Principles. To which it may be replied in ſhort (for the diſpute taken thus is become very remote from the Principall matter) that both Romans and Greeks were indeed a brave and a wiſe People, and ſuch as put a great Value upon themſelves, which when done upon juſt grounds is an effect of Magnanimity; But they have withall been ever Reſponſible to the learned part of the World, for their Arrogance in not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging how much they profited by the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne Nations, from whom it is demonſtrable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43887:11"/> They borrowed the greateſt part of what they had of Arts and Sciences. The Greeks and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans poſſeſt Much, yet what they wanted was More; But they taking the Much to be All, were in that Slaves to their owne thoughts which were much Narrower then the Nature of things.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond Objection, Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> gives ſomewhat an unexpected Anſwer; <hi>That having opened the Policy of Turky, He has not neglected</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>that of the Babylonians and Perſians, which are ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up in the other.</hi> The Controverſie is about the Antiquity of Regall and Popular Government, And becauſe it is manifeſt that many Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths are more Antient then the Turkiſh Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, which is of about three or foure hundred yeares, Muſt it therefore be concluded alſo that they are Antienter then the Aſſyrian and Perſian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, which are of three or foure thouſand yeares ſtanding? We are not more beholding to Mr <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> for his Diſcovery of the Ballance, then for the Invention of this excellent forme of Arguing.</p>
               <p>The third Inſtance is by Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> paſſed over in wiſe ſilence.</p>
               <p>As little Anſwer is returned to the Fourth. But upon occaſion of a Citation out of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> pleaſes himſelfe that He has found ſomething in that Author that makes for the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, which (ſlipping from the ſubject in hand) He runs away with, and proſecutes at large. But this Diſcourſe being ſomewhat unfortunately ſcattered in this Place, with Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Permiſſion it ſhall be tranſplanted to the Chapter <note place="margin">See cahp. 3.</note> of the Ballance, a ſoile more proper for it. And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43887:11"/> well we can part ſo; For it is to be doubted whether the Conſiderer is like to get ſo well off another place of the ſame Author; <hi>Never,</hi> ſaies Mr <hi>Harrington, did man make a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Choice for himſelfe then the Conſiderer has</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>of Thucydides, ſeeing what He affirmeth to have been Antient Prudence, is depoſed by his own Witneſs to have been the Imbecility of Antient Times. Thucyd. lib. 1. Pag. 3.</hi> Truly the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderer is a very unhappy Man, but his unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs lies not in the miſtaking of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> but of Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> from whom he expected to have ſeen ſome Probation, that the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which was Antient belonged not to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies; But He finds the Queſtion fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently transferred from the Antiquity, to the Prudence of Monarchicall Government, which in this Place came never before into Debate, and was ſuppoſed by Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> himſelfe both in his Diviſion and Definitions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Conſiderer will thank any man to tell him, Who is the Prevaricator now?</p>
               <p>Having thus detected the Cheat which was out of <hi>Thucydides</hi> put upon us concerning the Antiquity of Monarchicall Government among the Graecians, I ſhall not need to do more then admoniſh, That (in anſwer to the fift Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) the ſame is indeavoured out of <hi>Florus</hi> in Reference to the Romans.</p>
               <p>I make no Doubt there is enough ſaid for my own Vindication; but it were a criminall In juſtice to the memory of the excellent Gian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notti, if I ſhould not extend this Vindication
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43887:12"/> to Him alſo, and bring him off from that ſhare of the Abſurdity into which Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> has drawen him, by making him Author of the Diviſion of Prudence into Antient and Modern. It is no longer a Wonder to Me that Mr <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington's</hi> Adverſaries are uſed with ſo little Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, when I ſee his Friends meet with ſo little Honeſty; The injury he does Giannotti is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apparent, ſeeing the two Limits or Epocha's of time which Giannotti fixes have no refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Prudence, or Monarchicall and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Government, but reſpect only the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <note place="margin">Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There is beſides theſe Anſwers to my Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſomething in Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter relating to the Univerſity (for which He had not from Me the leaſt ſhadow of an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) which approaches very neere to Raving, and gives Me cauſe to ſuſpect I have fallen into a wrong Courſe of curing his Politicall diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, For whereas I think to do it by giving him more Light, knowing men are of Opinion,

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether a Common-wealth be rightly defined to be a Government of Laws, and not of Men, And a Monarchy to be the Government of ſome Man or few Men, and not of Laws.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the very Entrance of this Chapter I am charged by Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> with an Habituall Falſhood and Fraudulence in reciting his Words, for which I am thankfull to him, as for a ſeaſonable Diſcovery of his good Nature. The only Evidence to make good this Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be found to be, that inſtead of the Word Art, as it was in his Book, Act is twice printed in the Conſiderations. That this is an Error of the Preſſe, I might appeale to my own Copie, if it were not ſufficient to appeale to the Indifferent Reader, whether there can be any frandulence in ſuch a Variation, of which I make no Uſe, and which is not in the leaſt conducing to my Deſign. I envy Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> this handſome Confidence, that having been him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo miſerably handled by Printers, He ſhould
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43887:13"/> think fit to make Me reſponſible for all the ſinnes of the Preſs. But though I praiſe his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I cannot imitate his ſlender Ingenuity, by laying at his Doore the Nonſenſe and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in this laſt Book, though order be there taken, that they ſhould be imputed unto the Author himſelfe, In as much as the Printer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends (upon the laſt Page) to have corrected the Errors of his Preſs.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion under Debate in this Chapter is little more then a Controverſie about Words and Names, yet cannot be ſafely omitted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the uſe of thoſe Names the People have been alwaies deluded, and have (taking a Cloud for Juno) embraced them as Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Goods: Lawes and Liberty being the only True Charms, that I know of, in Nature, which by the meere ſound of Words produce Great and Reall Effects.</p>
               <p>That Law <hi>proceeds from the Will of Man,</hi> I <note place="margin">H. p. 7.</note> have Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> owne Confeſſion, and conſequently am juſtified for having ſaid, That Government is not in the Law, but in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whoſe Will gave a being to that Law. But I am complained of for wanting <hi>Honeſty to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider</hi> that this Will muſt have a Mover, and that this Mover is Intereſt. I never knew, that to be Honeſt, it was neceſſary to ſee more in another Man's buſineſſe then He ſees himſelf: I was at that time only concerned to find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in Government beyond Lawes, and ſuch was the Will of the Perſon which creates thoſe Lawes; If Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> does now think fit to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43887:13"/> conſider that this Will muſt be moved by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, I neither need nor meane to oppoſe him in it. I can be not only Honeſt but Liberall to Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> yet not to that Exceſs as to give him an Almes, when he begs no leſs then the whole Queſtion; For ſo much it amounts to where he ſaies, <hi>That the Intereſt of the whole</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>People coming up to the Publique Intereſt may be truly called the Empire of Lawes and not of Men,</hi> In order to this, let Me demand of him Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Commands impoſed upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique by One or a few Men are to be accounted Lawes? He has already taught Us they are to be ſo accounted where he ſaies <hi>That Law equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>proceeds from Will, whither of the whole People as in a Common-wealth, of one Man, as in an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, of few Men as in a Regulated Monarchy</hi> If ſo, what pretence of Reaſon can there be, That an Abſolute or Regulated Monarchy ſhould be eſteemed leſs a Government of Lawes then is a Common-wealth? On the other ſide let Me aske Him, Whether though one ſingle Perſon, or Ten or an Hundred Perſons making Lawes are to be lookt on as Men, yet if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to Ten or an hundred thouſand Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or include the whole People, They ſhall then ceaſe to be Men? Unleſs He will affirm this, How is it poſſible that a Common-wealth ſhould be leſs a Government of Men, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Abſolute or a Regulated Monarchy? To be plaine, If the Declared Will of the Supream Power be conſidered as the Immediate Cauſe of Government, then a Monarchy is as much
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43887:14"/> as a Common-wealth an Empire of Lawes and not of men: If we look further back, and conſider the Perſons whoſe Will is received as Law, a Common-wealth is as much as a Monarchy an Empire of Men and not of Lawes. This is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and yet Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> ſo firmely reſolved not to underſtand it, that conſidering his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per I muſt needs applaud his Reſolution of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to do with the Mathematiques, For halfe this Obſtinacy would be enough to keep him from apprehending, That the three Angles of a Triangle are equall to two Right Angles.</p>
               <p>Though I have ſaid more then enough in Anſwer to this double Queſtion, Whether a Common-wealth be rightly defined to be a Government of Lawes, and not of Men, And a Monarchy to be the Government of ſome Man or few Men, and not of Lawes; Yet I may ſeeme to have ſaid too little, unleſſe I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of an Argument which by Occaſion of this Diſpute has been ſtarted againſt Monarchy. Let it be admitted, may ſome Democratique ſay, that Monarchy is as much as a Commonwealth an Empire of Lawes, yet a Common-wealth muſt neceſſarily be an Empire of better Lawes <note place="margin">ibid.</note> then a Monarchy; <hi>For in a Monarchy the Lawes being made according to the Intereſt of one Man or a few Men, muſt needs be more private and Partiall then ſuites with the Nature of Juſtice, Whereas in a Common-wealth Lawes being made by the whole People, They come up to the Publique Intereſt, which is Common Right and Juſtice.</hi> This Propoſition has indeed Sence in it, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43887:14"/> the other wanted, but not any more Truth, as will be apparent if We examine the Differing Tempers of a ſingle Perſon, and of a Multitude enacting Lawes.</p>
               <p>When a ſingle Perſon or Monarch begins to think of eſtabliſhing any Law, He muſt in all Reaſon be then moſt ſenſible of thoſe Vaſt Cares which are never ſo preſſing as at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking an Action which drawes after it a long Traine of Conſequences; For upon the Eſtabliſhment and Execution of Good Lawes depends that Juſtice which preſerves every Man in his owne; The fruits of Juſtice are the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Welfare of the People, and from theſe flow Publique Peace and Security, which are a Princes firſt and Greateſt Intereſt: Hence it is evident that when a Monarch acts the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator's part, He ought to be ſo farre from Partiality or reſpecting his owne private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that He is then chiefly to Direct his Thoughts to the Common Good, and take the largeſt Proſpect of Publique Utility, in which his owne is ſo eminently included. Nor do I believe there can be many Examples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced of Princes who in enacting Lawes have conſidered their owne private Perſonall Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, ſince almoſt every where We ſee that in buying and ſelling, and other private Contracts, Princes are Content to tye themſelves up to the ſame Rules which they preſcribe to others. And even in thoſe Caſes where the Lawes made by Princes ſeeme moſt directed to their owne Intereſt, before We condemne them, It ought
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43887:15"/> to be examined, Whether ſuch Lawes be not Requiſite to the attaining the Ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, And Whether the Advantages in Power which Princes gaine by them be not abſolutely Neceſſary for the Conſervation of Publique Peace and Tranquillity; For then the Private Intereſt of the Prince, and the Publique Intereſt do no longer differ, but are one and the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide there cannot be a fonder Imagination then to think That when a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is aſſembled to enact Lawes, is is neceſſary their Reſolutions ſhould be conſonant to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Juſtice, and the Univerſall Intereſt; For a great Part will not for want of Capacity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what this Juſtice and Intereſt is; The abler ſort will preſently be divided into factions and Iuntas, and under Pretence of Publique In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt will proſecute their own Deſigns. I cannot underſtand how it is the Publique Intereſt of the whole People to Govern and make Lawes, but indeed to be ſo Governed and live under ſuch Lawes, that Juſtice may be impartially admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and Every Man preſerved in the Injoyment of his Own, which I have ſhown to be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's chiefe Care. It is to be remembred alſo that the greateſt Part of Lawes concern ſuch Matters as are the continuall Occaſion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between the People of a Nation; Such are the Lawes which reſpect the Regulation of all Contracts and Bargains, the Privileges of Companies and Corporations, the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Limitations of Manufactures, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43887:15"/> and Prohibitions of Traffique, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more of the ſame Nature, by all which ſome Part of the People being Gainers, and another Part Looſers, They cannot where their Intereſts are thus divided be ſo fitly qualified for Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as is a Prince who having no private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment going, can have no aime but the Common good. After all, it being eſſentiall to Popular Aſſemblies that the Plurality of Votes ſhould oblige the whole Body, thoſe Lawes which lay claime to the Conſent of all, are very often the Reſolutions of but a little more then halfe, And muſt conſequently go leſſe in their Pretenſions to Publique Intereſt.</p>
               <p>Let Us ſee how theſe Things have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Experience: And We ſhall every where find, That thoſe Lawes which are reputed the People's greateſt Security againſt In juſtice and Oppreſſion have been eſtabliſht by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſome Prince; Thus <hi>Alfred, Edward, Lewis, Alfonſo,</hi> in their ſeverall Ages and Dominions, haue been excellent Legiſlators; But above all, Severall of the Roman Emperours, and chiefly <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> have (by the Advice of a few private Men whoſe Aſſiſtance they voluntarily thought fit to make uſe of) fabricated thoſe Lawes ſo much admired for their Reaſon and Equity, which have ſtretcht themſelves further then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Roman Legions were able to march, and which are ſtill embraced by thoſe People who have long ſince ceaſed to acknowledge the Roman Empire.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, Thoſe Commonwealths
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43887:16"/> which have beene moſt celebrated for their Lawes, have received them from the hands of a ſole Legiſlator, as Athens and Sparta; Or elſe the People conſcious of their owne Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city that way, have inveſted ſome few Men with a Supreme Power for the Conſtitution of Laws, as the Romans did the <hi>Decem viri.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may well be doubted, whether theſe People thought ſo well of themſelves as Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> ſeemes to do of all Popular Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, while He with ſuch repeated Confidence aſſerts that the People never faile to judge truly of the Publique Intereſt where the Senate <note place="margin">Oceana p. 183.</note> diſcharge their Duty; If the Senate divide well He undertakes for the People they ſhall be ſure, to make a good Choice. For my part I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that this is too hard for my Faith, and that I rather think if <hi>Anacharſis</hi> were againe in the World, He would meet with Occaſion to renew the Obſervation He made of the Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Popular Aſſemblies, <hi>That wiſe Men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Plut. in Solon.</note> 
                  <hi>Matters, and Fooles decided them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To diſcover all the weake Arguments and falſe Inferences of Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> is a Work, to Others of ſo ſmall Profit, and to my ſelfe of ſo little Glory, that I reſolve to paſſe very ſlightly over that Paragraph where He tells Us, That it is not the Declaration of the Will of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigne Power which conſtitutes and revokes Lawes, but that it is with Lawes as with a Bond, which continues in force till all the Parties agree to repeal or Cancell it: He foreſaw the objection againſt this Example, <hi>That it is a private One,</hi> And
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43887:16"/> therefore <hi>puts the Caſe between ſeverall Princes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>States, or Governments, or between ſeverall States of the ſame Principality or Government.</hi> But though it may ſute very well with Mr <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington's</hi> Occaſions to Put this Caſe, it will not become Us to admit of it, who ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the Leagues and Confederacies between ſeverall Princes or States have nothing of the Nature of a Bond in them; For when either Party thinks fit to recede from them (though in it ſelfe it may be an Act of Injuſtice) there is no ſuperiour Tribunall to appeale to, by which the Party can be conſtrained to ſtand to the Obligation, but the Buſineſſe muſt be determined by a War. Much leſſe have they any thing of the Nature of Law in them, unleſſe, as Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> ſeemes to be of Opinion, Princes or States may make Lawes not only for themſelves but for their Neighbours too; Which <hi>Maxime</hi> agreeing ſo well with his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative humour, may one day ſerve to produce as fine Models of Government for France or Spaine, as he has given us for England. Nor is the Caſe altered by putting it <hi>betweene the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeverall States of the ſame Principality or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> For if any one of theſe States have, in Caſe of Difference, a juſt Power to force the obedience of the Other, it is all one as if they were private Perſons; But if no One of them be acknowledged to have ſuch Power over the Reſt, Then in caſe of their Diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there remaines no knowne Sovereigne Power, but that Nation is reduced to the State
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43887:17"/> of War; From whence it is evident That they were not at firſt to have been conſidered as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall States of the ſame Government, but as equall Independent Ones which were only joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together by ſome League or Union.</p>
               <p>Before I finiſh this Chapter I muſt retract an Error of which Hr <hi>Harrington</hi> has convinced Me: He had affirmed That for Mr <hi>Hobs</hi> to ſay <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> wrote not the Rules of their Politiques from the Principles of Nature but tranſcribed them into their Books out of the Practiſe of their own Common-wealths, was as if a Man ſhould ſay of famous <hi>Harvey</hi> that He tranſcribed his Circulation of the Blood, not out of the Principles of Nature; but out of the Anatomy of this or that Body: To which I replied, That the whole force of the Objection amounted but to this, That becauſe <hi>Harvey</hi> in his Circulation hath followed the Principles of Nature, therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> have done ſo in their Diſcourſes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. I confeſs, The Affirmation not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it ſelfe manifeſt, and I ignorant of any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to take it upon Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Word, I thought the Probation of it muſt lye in the Reſemblance of <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> and <hi>Livie's</hi> Books of Government with <hi>Harveys</hi> of Circulation: But this was an Error in Me, and an Injury to Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> For in his laſt book He has aſſured <note place="margin">H. p. 9.</note> Me, that He produced it only as a <hi>Similitude,</hi> and never intended that any Man ſhould look for <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Argument</hi> in it. I heartily crave his Pardon, and by way of Reparation to him,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43887:17"/> I make here a ſolemn Declaration, That for the future He ſhall have no Cauſe to accuſe Me for expecting Reaſon or Argument in any of his Diſcourſes.</p>

                  <p>Whether the Ballance of Dominion in Land be the Naturall Cauſe of Empire.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Shall lye under a very great Diſcouragement in the Proſecution of this Conteſt with Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> unleſs ſome ſuch Rules may be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh't between Us, as are obſerved by the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions at a Country Wake; That He who gets a broken Head is for that Time <hi>Hors du jeu,</hi> and muſt not take up the Cudgels any more. For if Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> may continue the Liberty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating (notwithſtanding my Anſwers) whole Pages of his <hi>Oceana</hi> without any Addition of Argument, It will be eaſy for him every Month to impregnate the Preſs with a New great Book. Of this his Repitition I give Notice once for all, being unwilling to be ſo frequent in the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition as He is in the Practiſe of it.</p>
               <p>Yet We are not to think that there is nothing New in his laſt Book, for though his Reaſons ſtand at a ſtay, his Confidence improves hugely, and He now tels Us, that (in Deſpight of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiques) <hi>by the Doctrine of the Ballance He</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>has made the Politiques the moſt Demonſtrable of any Art whatſoever.</hi> I am ſorry I have ſo little Credit with Him, elſe I ſhould ſoberly adviſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43887:18"/> him to obtain from this Word Demonſtration, for though it fiils his Mouth admirably, ſome have taken Occaſion to doubt it has left a great dealeof empty roome in his Head.</p>
               <p>The Invention of the Ballance He jealouſly aſſerts to be his own; Though in another place he begins to doubt that <hi>Phaleas</hi> the Chalcedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian may diſpute it with Him; And that with great Reaſon, ſeeing it is evident out of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> (though it be rejected by him, as I ſhall hereafter diſcover) that <hi>Phaleas</hi> did many Ages ſince light upon the ſame Phanſie, I feare alſo that He will in another Reſpct prove of the younger houſe, for many Months before the Publication of his Oceana, there came forth a Letter, pretended to be ſent <hi>from an Officer of the Army in Ireland to his Highneſs the LORD PROTECTOR, concerning his changing of the Government,</hi> in which the Doctrine of the Ballance, was not obſcurely hinted. But this laſt will (it may be) trouble Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> but little, ſince it is not unlikely the Author of that Letter goes a ſhare in the Commonwealth of Oceana. However, I ſhall not make my ſelfe Judge of this Controverſie, but rather, being Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> has thought fit to walk over the ſame Ground again in this Chapter of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, take that Occaſion to apply my ſelfe to a more accurate Diſcuſſion of the whole Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then I before thought Neceſſary. Which will be beſt performed by theſe Graduall Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Dominion in Land is a meere
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43887:18"/> Effect of Empire, and therefore cannot be the Cauſe of it, unleſs to be the Cauſe and the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect be but one and the ſame thing. Originally every man had Right to every thing, and no One Man had more Title to one Piece of Land, then He had to any other Piece, and then Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man had to the ſame Piece: Or if this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion be thought too large, at leaſt There was no ſetled Propriety before the Eſtabliſhment of Empire, nor could any Man be ſaid to have the Dominion of that Land, from whence He might be immediatly ejected by the Violence of the next Invader. But after the Eſtabliſhment of Empire, when the United Force of thoſe who became Subject to One Sovereign Power was grown greater then could be reſiſted by Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Men, Then and not before was Propriety and Dominion in Land fixed according to ſuch Rule and Proportion as the Sovereign Power thought Requiſite. As for thoſe two waies of <hi>Naturall and Violent Revolution</hi> by which Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> imagines <hi>Propriety may come to have a being before Empire,</hi> they are not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted further then in Reference to this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Empire, and ſo indeed Propriety may be ſaid to be before Empire, as the Propriety of the Families of <hi>Naſſau</hi> or <hi>Brederode</hi> to their Lands, was before the Empire of the States of <hi>Holland:</hi> But then this Propriety depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome former Empire, and would no longer continue to be Propriety if the ſucceeding Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, (be it either by Naturall or Violent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution) did not allow and Authorize it.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43887:19"/> Wherefore it is evident, That ſeeing Dominion in Land depends meerly upon Empire, it muſt needs be a groſs Abſurdity to ſay, <hi>That the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Dominion in Land is the Naturall Cauſe of Empire.</hi> If notwithſtanding this it can be made out, that there is ſuch a Complication of Empire with the Ballance in Land that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the Ballance is neceſſary to the health and long Life of Empire, To fit Empire to the Ballance is to ſet the Sun by the Clock, The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in Land being in that Caſe to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſuch a Ballance as beſt ſutes with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: Which inverts the Aime, and at once over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the whole Modell of the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the ſecond Place, This Illation need not be perſued, becauſe I think it may with very good Reaſon be aſſerted That Juſtice is that by which all Empires ſubſiſt, and come to be (as far as humane Inſtability permits) Eternall. It is an Error to think (as has been already touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that the Generality of a People are infected with a Deſire of Sovereign Power, and will not be ſatisfied with Protection in their preſent Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and Incouragement in Acquiring more by the way of a Regular Induſtrie. The Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, <note place="margin">Ariſt. Polit. lib. 4. cap. 13. &amp; lib. 4. cap. 8.</note> ſaies <hi>Ariſtole,</hi> are not diſguſted at being excluded from the Government, but rather are very well pleaſed to ſit Quiet and be at leaſure to follow their own Buſineſs, unleſs they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt and ſee their Governours make havock of the Publique. If a Prince be carefull of the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, and do not by any
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43887:19"/> Publique, or ſignall private Violation of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate his Subjects, He need not fear the want of their Aſſiſtance for the Defence of his Throne, All Popular Commotions that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in a Nation being grounded upon Pretence, at leaſt, of ſome Injuſtice in the Governour. And though this Prince be overballanced in Land by any Part of the People, it does not therefore follow, That they will refuſe to continue under his Government, as long as it is adminiſtred with Juſtice: For it is a chief Part of the Function of the Supream Magiſtrate to be as it were a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Arbitrator, to whom the Deciſion of all Controverſies among his Subjects is referred, and We know that in an Arbitrator, it is not Riches but Integrity and Ability that Men look after; Nor have I heard any reaſon why a Poore Man, if known to be honeſt, may not be truſted to keep ſtakes in a Wager for more then his Eſtate comes to.</p>
               <p>Yet becauſe the Actions of a Prince though in themſelves juſt, may though Miſtake or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice not be conſidered as ſuch by a People, I do not meane that a Prince ſhould be deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of all Power but what He gains by the Opinion of his Juſtice and Innocence; And therefore in the third Place I deſcend to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how far Riches conduce to Sovereign Power, and Whether an Eſtate in Land is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Productive of Empire more then any other Revenue.</p>
               <p>The Reparation of our Subſtance by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43887:20"/> Supplies of Meat and Drink, And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our Bodies (in cold Countreys eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) from the Injuries of the Weather by Garments and Habitations, are the firſt and moſt Naturall Cares of Mankind; We did not long continue ſatisfied with what was purely neceſſary of this Sort, but ſoon grew up to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Convenience and the Reall pleaſing our Senſes, And at laſt came to ſeek after things of Luxurie and Vanity, which depend altogether upon Opinion. And becauſe no Man by his ſingle Power could be ſecure in the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any of theſe Things, there was an early Willingneſs in Men to ſubmit to Empire, that by their United Force (which is that We call Sovereign Power) They might be maintained (upon ſuch Terms as the Sovereign Power pleaſed to eſtabliſh) in the Acquiring and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing ſuch Things as tended to the Ends alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mentioned: This was the Introduction of Propriety. At firſt this conſiſted only in the Fruits of the Earth and Cattle, And He who had Land enough to bring forth more of theſe then He could conſume, was a Rich Man, and might with the Superfluity drive ſome little Commerce by way of Exchange with the Neighbourhood. But after that Men had found out a way of Entercourſe with People far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and a more conſiderable Traffique be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſet on foot, Something was fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by generall Conſent which might be the Common Meaſure of the Value of all Things needfull to Man; This is called Mony, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43887:20"/> by it's Portability and Currentneſs having a great Advantage in the Uſe of it, a Value came alſo to be put upon That, known by the Name of Uſury or Intereſt. And now He that abounds with Mony, need not be in want of ſuch Things as are Uſefull to him, becauſe other Men will for his Mony be glad to let him have part of their Superfluity.</p>
               <p>Out of this We may infer, That ſince the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of Propriety by the Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has rendred it neither Free nor Safe for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Men to make Uſe of Force in gaining ſuch Things as they ſtand in need of, Riches do highly conduce to Power; For Men that are unprovided of other meanes of acquiring ſuch Things as They can not want, are faine to apply themſelves to the Rich for obtaining of them, Who do not uſe to part with them, but in Exchange of ſome Service or Subjection by which they grow Powerfull. Yet this Power gained by Riches is alwaies dependant upon the Sovereign Power which Inſtitutes and preſerves Propriety; For againſt a Force ſtrong enough (ſuch as are Conqueſts and ſuccesfull Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions) to overthrow the ſetled Propriety by the Subverſion of the Sovereign Power, Riches are not of any Defence, but rather matter of Invitation to an Enemy by the greatneſs of the Booty.</p>
               <p>We may alſo infer That where there is no Traffique or Mony, as in new Plantations, the Riches which conduce to Power conſiſt in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Land able to produce ſuch Things as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43887:21"/> are neceſſary or Convenient to Subſiſtence; But in other Places where the Eſtimate and Purchaſe of all uſefull things is reduced to Mony, there the Influence which Riches have upon Power flows not from an Eſtate in Land only, but principally and immediatly from ready Mony; Or to make uſe of Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Words, The Ballance of Dominion in Land is not the Naturall Cauſe of Empire.</p>
               <p>This was of old known to Ariſtotle, who having related the Project of <hi>Phaleas</hi> the Chalcedonian to ſettle a Government by reducing Eſtates to an Equality, with the expedient invented by him to bring it to paſs, At laſt He rejects it for this Reaſon chiefly; <hi>That He had not conſidered aright of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ariſt. Polit. lib. 2. cap. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>this equality, having only indeavoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce it in Land,</hi> (What is this but Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Ballance in Land?) <hi>Whereas Riches conſisted as well in Slaves, and Cattle, and Mony, and Furniture, in all of which He ought to have ſetled the ſame Equality or Moderate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, or elſe altogether to have omitted that Phanſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Particular alſo Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> ſeems to have loſt ground to the Conſiderer; for whereas He at firſt maintained that the Ballance <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Oceana</hi> p. 5.</note> in Mony can be equall to that of Land only in Places of great Trade and little no Land as <note place="margin">H. p. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> He is now faine to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> too, the Countreys being narrow and the Lots at a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43887:21"/> low ſcantling, if Uſury in the One and in the other Mony had not been forbid, Mony would have eaten out the Ballance of Land. This is upon the Matter to ſurrender the whole Queſtion, and to Allow that in all Places where there is mony enough to hold any conſiderable Proportion to the Land (And the Conſiderer was not ſo ſenſeleſs to think there could be weight in empty Bags) There the Ballance in Mony does concur to Empire as much as that in Land.</p>
               <p>So then Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Aſſertion is not a little ſtreightned, and He that undertook to make good in the Generall that Empire reſts upon the Ballance in Land, is content it ſhould prove ſo only <hi>in a Territory of ſuch extent as</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Spain or England, where the Land can not be overballanced by Mony.</hi> For this He offers three Arguments, the firſt of which belongs not it ſeems to the Matter but the Man. The Conſiderer had ſaid that to make Wiſedome or Riches the firſt Principle of Government, were as unjuſt as it would be to oblige Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> to give his Cloths or Mony to <note place="margin">ibid.</note> the next Man he meets Wiſer or Richer then himſelf. <hi>If he had ſaid ſtronger,</hi> ſaies Mr <hi>Harrington, he had ſpoiled all.</hi> Tis very true, the Conſiderer knew that, and therefore did not ſay ſo. Is that a Crime? He has in more then one place of the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made appeare what Influence He thinks force had Originally upon Government, and therefore there is no Reaſon to take it ill
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43887:22"/> that He did not in this place contradict his own Opinion: <hi>But,</hi> Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> continues to urge, <hi>The Richer as to the Caſe in Debate is the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and if the People have Riches, that is Clothe; or Mony of their own, they muſt riſe out of the Propriety or Cultivation of Land, and ſo the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Land muſt of Neceſſity be in the People themſelves, who having that will never give their</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Clothes or Mony or Obedience unto a ſingle Perſon or a Nobility, though theſe ſhould be the richer in Mony, whence it is evident that in ſuch a Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trry as England or Spain, Mony can never come to overballance Land.</hi> A fine Modeſt Argument this, which though it be called a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhould never ſuſpected to have been meant for a Mathematicall One, but that I find it going upon certain <hi>Data</hi> or <hi>Poſtulata,</hi> two of which by Misfortune happen to be the very things which were to be proved, As firſt, that if the People have Riches they muſt riſe out of the Propriety or Cultivation of Land, And then that Ready Mony though in never ſo great a Quantity cannot outweigh the Ballance in Land. To ſpeak freely, This whole Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage has ſo little Affinity with ſenſe, that I muſt believe Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> was in Choler, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it as a Piece of Revenge againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderer, for having dared to put a Suppoſition that any Man could be Wiſer then the <hi>Author of Oceana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſecond Argument (and that's called a Demonſtration too) is <hi>that Henry the ſeventh,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>though the richeſt in Mony of Engliſh Princes did</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:43887:22"/> 
                  <hi>by making Farms of a Standard, and cutting of Retainers begin that Breach in the Ballance of Land, which hath ſince ruin'd the Government.</hi> But did that Ruine ſwallow up the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment while that ready mony was in being? Or did not his Son <hi>Henry</hi> the eight by his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and unprofitable Wars exhauſt all that Treaſure in a few of the firſt years of his Reign? I may with Modeſty and Truth enough let Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> know that if the Exchecquer had eighteen years agoe been as well furniſht as <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the ſeventh left it, He might now probably have wanted the Occaſion of ſhewing his Skill in Modelling a Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>The third Argument is, <hi>That the Monarchy of Spain ſince that King had the Indies, ſtands upon the ſame Ballance in the Lands of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, on which it alwaies ſtood.</hi> This it ſeems We muſt believe for Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> ſake without any further Proof, though the Oppoſite Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That it does not ſtand upon the ſame Ballance, was profered as an Inſtance againſt him by the Conſider; Who can now fortify his Side by this Obſervation, That from the Diſcovery of the <hi>American</hi> Mines to the yeare 1640 (a Tract of time of more then 120 years) the Crown of Spain has not been diſturbed by any Domeſtick ſedition of the Nobility, for which there cannot any ſo Probable Reaſon be aſſigned, as the Increaſe of the King's Revenue in ready Mony by which he is inabled to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Force that overballances their Eſtates in Land.</p>

               <p>Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Arguments being thus fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Replies, it will be expedient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Conſideration of thoſe waies by which a Revenue both Private and Publique may be raiſed, that ſo We may the better judge, Whether in ſuch a Territory as Spain or England Mony may not come to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance Land: But I do not think it belongs to Me to do this with the Accurateneſs either of a Philoſopher who diſcourſes (as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> does in the ſecond of his <hi>Oeconomicks)</hi> of all the ſeverall poſſible waies of managing an Eſtate, Or of a <hi>Financier</hi> who makes a Propoſition for the raiſing a preſent ſumme of Ready Mony. It will be enough to obſerve in generall the moſt ready and Naturall Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods by which a Conſiderable Revenue may be obtained.</p>
               <p>The Firſt of theſe is by the Propriety and Cultivation of Lands, which is a very generall Way, and the ſole Conſiderable One in ſuch Places where the Methods hereafter expreſt are not practicable. Out of this, in ſome Places, a certain Tax or Proportion is payable to the Sovereign Power, by which the Owner looſes no part of his Propriety, yet has as it were a Rent Charge laid upon his Eſtate.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is taken from the Bowels of the Earth, which in ſome Parts are fertile of thoſe Metals that need only the ſtroke of an Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to make them Current Mony; Theſe are either belonging ſolely to the Supream Power though taken out of other Men's Ground, as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43887:23"/> here in England, Or at leaſt a great ſhare of them belongs to the Prince, as it is with the King of Spain in reſpect of all the Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is by Traffique and Commerce; And that either Private and Domeſtick, as carrying the Commodities of a Man's own Grouth to Market, and Mean <hi>Artiſans</hi> ſelling their Work to the Neighbourhood, which are often charged by the Publique with ſome Exciſe or Gabell; Or elſe Publique and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, when by Publique Authority Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies are formed for the better Exportation and Importation of Goods and Manufacture: And out of theſe ſome conſiderable Duties and Cuſtomes, do almoſt every where iſſue to the Publique Revenue.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt is from the Profit of Mony by Uſury, And that alſo either Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, when every Man puts out his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, upon which ſome Aſſeſſement, payable by the Lender, to the Publique ought in all Reaſon to be impoſed, Uſurers being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very unprofitable Members of a State, and the only Men who contribute nothing to the Publique Charge: Or elſe Publique under the Inſpection and Security of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power, commonly known by the name of Banks, by which no ſmall Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue uſes to accrue to the Publique.</p>
               <p>Now to ſhew that in Spain or England the three laſt waies of raiſing a Revenue may
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43887:24"/> be more conſiderable then the firſt, Or, which is all One, that Mony may overballance Land, will not be difficult, if We conſider that Spain (And if <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh had given eare to <hi>Columbus</hi> his Profer England had been Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of the ſame Treaſures) is poſſeſt of all the Bullion of the Weſt Indies amounting annually (not to mention greater Summes gained at the firſt Diſcovery of thoſe Countries) to 3 or 4 millions of our Mony, which is by Mr <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington's</hi> Calculation a full third of all the Land in England. Next, Spain or England are either of them by Nature endowed with all Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages for taking the whole Traffique of the World into their Hands, and are inferiour to the Dutch who injoy it, in nothing but Induſtrie: What the Importance of this is or might be, the Dutch will beſt help Us to Underſtand, Who by that alone without any conſiderable Land, have been able to baffle Spain, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with England. And if Spain or England have or may have ſuch a Traffique; They may alſo when they pleaſe erect a Bank for any the Greateſt ſumme of Mony.</p>
               <p>Againſt this Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> has but One Objection in ſtore, which is, <hi>That the Purſe of a Prince never yet made a Bauke, nor till Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and Trading Mony be all one, ever ſhall; Where there is a Bank, Ten to One there is a Commonwealth.</hi> This does Us no hurt, For if England or Spain were a Commonwealth, their Ballance in Mony might then outweigh that in Land, which is the Thing contended for. But
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43887:24"/> He will be in Danger to looſe his Wager, and his Credit to boot; For ſome Monarchs have been as great Traders as any Commonwealths; The example of the <hi>Medices</hi> he yields Me, to that I will adde the Crown of Portugall, which preſently after the Diſcovery of the Cape of good Hope did manage that mighty <hi>Lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Traffique which now the Dutch and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſhare with them: The Examples of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor</hi> and other Eaſtern Princes may alſo be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, who though Monarchs are very great Traders. And where there is a Traffique, it is undeniable but that, if it be found expedient, there may be a Bank; Or is <hi>Antwerp</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, or the <hi>Monti</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> planted in a Popular Government?</p>
               <p>It would not be unfit alſo that before We conſent <hi>to reſolve that in ſuch a Territory as England Mony can never overballance Land,</hi> We did a little reflect upon the Succeſſes of our laſt Wars, and inquire Whether it was not the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the City of <hi>London</hi> which turned the Scales.</p>
               <p>Having thus examined what the Influence of Riches is upon Empire, What the Importance of Propriety in Land, and What that of ready Mony, in ſuch a Territory particularly as Spain or England, I may with reaſon expect not to be thought to have <hi>ſtrained very much at the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Doctrine of the Ballance,</hi> much leſs, <hi>to have been choaked with it.</hi> I conſeſs I cannot ſwallow it ſo faſt as Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> but that, it may be, does not hinder Me from digeſting it better.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43887:25"/> At leaſt I have leiſure to obſerve that while He attributes ſo much to the Ballance, He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits an Error in making an Army depend meerly upon the Riches of thoſe who have the Diſpoſing of it: For though it be true <hi>That an Army is a Beaſt with a great Belly which ſubſisteth not without very large Pastures,</hi> It is as true that this Beaſt is none of thoſe tame Ones that are kept within Fences, or impriſoned in a Severall: When an Army is once on foot, the Incloſure of the Law is too weak to hold it in, And Propriety is no better then an Hedge of rotten Sticks. It was the Obſervation of Him who had Wit and Experience enough to be the Founder of the Roman Monarchy, <hi>That Men</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dion. Caſs. lib. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>and Mony are the two Things by which Power is acquired and preſerved, And that theſe two do mutually ſupport One another; For as by Mony an Army is brought together, So He that has Arms in his hand need not want Mony.</hi> Thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven after the Settlement of Propriety by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Lawes, Force goes a ſhare with Riches, and is not wholly excluded from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to the Eſtabliſhment of Empire.</p>
               <p>Nay further, If there comes to be a Conteſt between Gold and Iron, the Advantage gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally remains with the harder Metall, And He that has Arms in his Hand, may when He plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes both command the Mony in his Neighbours Pocket, and alſo gather the Rents of his Lands: As it of old fell out among the <hi>Thurians,</hi> Where the Nobility had ingroſt all Offices and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy into their own Hands, and had bought
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43887:25"/> (though againſt the Law) the Lands of the <note place="margin">Ariſt. Polit.</note> whole Country; Yet the People being exerciſed &amp; inured to the Wars, proved too hard for the Nobility and their Guard, And diſmiſſed them of their Power and exceſſive Poſſeſſions in Land. From which Example theſe two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollaries are evidently deduceable, That an Agrarian Law is not a ſufficient Proviſion for fixing the Ballance, And that the Conformity of the Ballance to the eſtabliſh't Government does not neceſſarily ſecure a State from Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Revolutions.</p>
               <p>One thing more remains to diſpatch this Queſtion of the Ballance, And that is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Examples of ſuch Governments as have been ſetled contrary to the Ballance in Land; But I find by the whole Courſe of Mr <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington's</hi> Reply to Me, that this way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is of no great Efficacy with Him, For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He takes no Notice of ſuch Examples, or by ſome pitifull unmanly Cavill ſeeks to elude them. Wherefore I am put to make uſe of another Method, that is to bring him as a Witneſs againſt himſelf, and to prove this Point by the Authority of his own Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In the 73 page of his Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Ordination againſt Dr <hi>Hamond,</hi> He has imparted this Leſſon to Us; <hi>The People of Egypt till having ſold their Lands they came to looſe their Popular Ballance, were not ſervants unto Pharaoh, wherefore when Joſeph was made Governour over all Egypt they were Free.</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:43887:26"/> And in Conſequence to this We are told by him <note place="margin">H. p. 56.</note> in another Place, That the Ballance of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarchy or of a Nobility came into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> by the Purchaſe of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> But it is evident that the Exerciſe of Sovereign Power was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore belonging to the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> in a moſt Abſolute manner, ſeeing the People when not only their whole Fortunes and Eſtates, but their very Lives alſo lay at ſtake by the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Famine, had not force enough to break open the Granaries and take out Corne for their ſuſtenance, but were faine to buy it of the King at his own Price. And if the People of <hi>Egypt</hi> had not in the Caſe of extream hunger (which uſes to inrage the moſt abject and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh People of the whole World) Power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſerve themſelves when there was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of Corne in the Land, It is ridiculous to think they could retain any Power or Liberty in reference to the Government. Wherefore the Ballance of <hi>Egypt</hi> being Popular, and the Government Abſolute Monarchy, Mr <hi>Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> himſelf has furniſhed Us with a cleare Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a Government that has been ſetled contrary to the Ballance in Land.</p>
               <p>I might by this time lawfully hope for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe from this Diſpute of the Ballance, if I were not ingaged by my Promiſe in the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to examine that place of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> which by diverting the Diſcourſe gave Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> the Opportunity of ſaying ſomething upon a Subject in which He muſt otherwiſe have been ſilent. But what He has there ſaid is ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43887:26"/> and wandering from the true meaning of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> that I muſt needs think either He has parted with his own Underſtanding, or believes his Readers willing to part with theirs. Let the firſt 12 or 14 Pages of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> which ſerve as an Introduction to his Hiſtorie, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately peruſed, And it will be found to be the Author's aime to make it appear, That the Actions he goes about to deſcribe were more great and conſiderable then any had formerly been performed by the <hi>Graecians.</hi> To this end He relates, <hi>That of old, Greece was not conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Thucyd. p. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>inhabited, but that at firſt there were often Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movals, every One eaſily leaving the place of his Abode to the Violence of ſome greater Number. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man ſo husbanded the Ground, as but barely to live upon it without any ſtock of Riches, and planted Nothing, but made account to be Masters in any Place of ſuch neceſſary Sustenance, as might ſerve from day to day. And for this Cauſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Id. p. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>they were of no Ability at all, either for greatneſs of Cities, or other Proviſion. And the Imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Antient Times is not a little demonstrated alſo by this, That before the Trojan War nothing appeareth to have been done by Greece in Common.</hi> This then is Manifeſt to have been the oldeſt Condition of <hi>Greece,</hi> That though the People were not abſolutely deſtitute of Civill Society, yet thoſe Societies being of very ſmall Numbers were too weak to improve by Plantation or Traffique, but were forced to abandon their Habitations to the Violence of ſuch whom the fatneſs of the Soile invited thither. And as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43887:27"/> theſe Societies of Men were of themſelves weak and inconſiderable, ſo were they without any League or Union in Common, by which this their Imbecillity might have received a Cure. Sutable to their Condition was their manner of living, <hi>To weare Iron, or be alwaies in Arms,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>and to count Theeving the beſt means of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, being a Matter at that time no where in Diſgrace, but rather carrying with it ſomething of Glory. But Minos having built a Navy, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators had the Sea more free, For He expelled the Malefactors out of the Iſlands, and in moſt of</hi>

                  <hi>them planted Colonies of his own. By which meanes They who inhabited the Sea coaſts, becoming more addicted to Riches, grew more conſtant to their dwellings; Of whom ſome grown now Rich com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed their Towns about with Wals. For out of deſire of gaine, the meaner ſort underwent Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with the Mighty; And the Mighty with their Wealth brought the leſſer Cities into Subjection.</hi> It appeares by this that the firſt conſiderable increment of <hi>Greece</hi> was by King <hi>Minos,</hi> who having ſuppreſt the Pirates, and render'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation ſafe, the Maritime Cities by their Traffique ſoon began to grow Rich, and for their Security fortified themſelves, and by theſe Advantages (People in want flocking to their Service) they prevailed over the leſſer Cities, and grew up to ſome indifferent Force, with which the War of <hi>Troy</hi> was undertaken: <hi>Which Enterprize though of greater Name then any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was through want of Mony but weake, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

After the Trojan War alſo the Graecians continued ſtill their Shiftings and Tranſplantations, inſomuch as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſting they improved not their Power. But after a long time Greece had conſtant Reſt, and ſhifting their ſeats no longer at length ſent Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Id.</hi> p. 9.</note> ahroad. When the Power of Greece was now improved, and the deſire of Mony with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, their Revenues being inlarged in moſt of the Cities there were erected Tyrannies. (For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time Kingdomes with Honours limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were Hereditary.) And the Graecians built Navies, and became more ſeriouſly addicted to the Affaires of the Sea.</hi> Yet was not their Navall force very great, for having ſpoken of ſuch Fleets as had been brought together ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Tyrants or Cities, and of the Actions performed by them, He concludes, <hi>That if Men conſider of the War he deſcribes by the Acts done in the ſame, It will manifeſt it ſelf to be greater then any of thoſe before mentioned.</hi> Theſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Id.</hi> p. 13.</note> are the Paſſages of <hi>Thucydides</hi> out of which Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> goes about, by an unheard of Chymiſtry, to extract the Doctrine of the Ballance; But He muſt give Me leave to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe Errors and Falſe Conſequences in his Operation.</p>
               <p>Firſt He ſaies that <hi>When out of deſire of gain the Meaner Sort underwent Servitude with the Mighty, It cauſed Hereditary Kingdomes with Honours limited; As happened alſo with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s ſince the times of the Goths and Vandals.</hi> Good!

                  </note> We will be content to acknowledge this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43887:28"/> Force of the Ballance, that Prudence which He himſelf cals Modern, and will have to be firſt introduced into the World after the breaking of the Roman Empire, ſhall be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be more ancient then the moſt ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiques. But I beſeech him Where does He find that the Servitude the meaner Sort under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went with the Mighty cauſed Hereditary King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes? <hi>Thucydides</hi> owns no ſuch Cauſality, Nor do thoſe two paſſages of His thus joyned together by Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> appear to have any Reference to one another. Nay on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is manifeſt that Hereditary Kingdomes were before that Servitude, ſeeing that Servitude happened not till after <hi>Minos,</hi> who was a King, had by ſcouring the Seas of Pirates and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying their Neſts, given Security to Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, by which and not by the Ballance of Land theſe Cities grew Potent.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Place, He attributes the Power of <hi>Pelops</hi> to the Ballance in Land, Whereas <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi> ſaies expreſly, <hi>He obtained this Power by the abondance of Wealth He brought with him out of Aſia, to Men in want.</hi> Did He tranſport his Land with Him? Or is not this a cleare Inſtance of the Prevalence of Mony againſt the Ballance in Land?</p>
               <p>But then thirdly, He at the ſame time ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes no Propriety in Land till after the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, And yet makes before that War the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballancing of the Mighty to be the Cauſe of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Kingdomes. This has the aſpect of a Contradiction, into which it is likely he ſlipt,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43887:28"/> by not having a true apprehenſion of <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> who does not affirm there was in thoſe remote Ages He treats of, a time when there was no Propriety, but only that Men being not yet united into great Nations, but living in ſmall Clans, there joynt Force was not ſufficient to defend them againſt the Violence of ſuch who had any ſmall oddes in Number, which was the Cauſe of ſo frequent Tranſmigrations.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He will have the Revenues of <hi>Greece</hi> which were inlarged about the Time of erecting the Tyrannies, to conſiſt only in Land, unleſs forſooth We can ſhew there was Uſurie at that Time: He muſt pardon Me for this alſo, It is enough that there then began to be great Trading, which is plainly teſtified by <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> where He ſaies <hi>That the Graecians became more ſeriouſly addicted to the Affaires of the Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, He imagines the difference between the old Hereditary Monarchies and the new ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Tyrannies to have been only in the Peoples Apprehenſion of them, who being grown Rich called that Government Tyrannie, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore during their Poverty, They had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to own for a lawfull Monarchy. This is indeed to be a true Servant to his own Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but not to be a faithfull Hiſtorian of the Actions of other Men; For in ſome of theſe Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies the change from Monarchy muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Princes themſelves, Who upon <note place="margin">Ariſt. Polit. lib. 3. cap. 15. &amp; lib. 5. cap. 10.</note> the increaſe of Wealth having put off the Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Moderation of their Predeceſſors, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43887:29"/> addicted themſelves to <hi>Avarice</hi> and <hi>Luxurie,</hi> or as <hi>Thucydides</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>Their deſire of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being improved with their Power,</hi> governed their People with all manner of Inſolence and Oppreſſion. But moſt of the Tyrannies were then at that time firſt erected, for the old Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies having by the failing of the Royall <note place="margin">Ariſt. Polit. lib. 3. cap. 14. &amp; lib. 5. cap. 5.</note> Lines, or by the remiſſeneſs of the Princes been changed into Commonwealths, the Supream Power was afterward uſurped by ſuch Perſons who having no juſt Claime, were forced to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves by Violent and Tyrannicall Courſes.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, Becauſe <hi>Thucydides</hi> comparing only the Actions of the old Graecians with thoſe He is about to deſcribe, gives the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the latter, calling the other <hi>the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity of Antient Times,</hi> He would therefore have it thought, that the Conſiderer has made an unlucky choiſe of <hi>Thucydides</hi> his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But it is eaſy for Me to convince him, that though I had on my ſide no other Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony (which by the way is untrue, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being atteſted by all the Greek Hiſtories of thoſe remote Ages) but this of <hi>Thucydides</hi> I were upon Terms ſecure enough: For firſt <hi>Thucydides</hi> mentions this Imbecillity only in reference to the times before the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, and not the whole time that <hi>Greece</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Hereditary Monarchs; And then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, this Imbecillity is no diminution of the Antiquity of that Government, (which was the ſole thing at that time in Debate between
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43887:29"/> Us) nor yet any Imputation to the Prudence of it; For it is not to be underſtood of any Morall or Politicall Imbecillity radicated in the Nature of that Government, but of a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall one equally attending the Infancy of all Governments; Arms, Shipping, Mony and the other Proviſion by which a Nation frees it ſelf from this Imbecillity, being not origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or eſſentiall Members of any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but like Haire the Productions of Age and Grouth.</p>
               <p>I could not at a leſs Expence of Time and Pains ſatisfie my Promiſe to conſider theſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of <hi>Thucydides;</hi> To ſome Readers it will not, poſſibly, be unacceptable to have been reſcued from an Erroneous Apprehenſion of of that excellent Author; For my own part I gain by it the ſatisfaction of obſerving that I am not the only Perſon who ſuffer by Mr <hi>Harrington.</hi>

The Queſtion was put by the Conſiderer, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there may not be a Mixture of the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and Provinciall Ballance, ſo that the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Parts of an Empire may come to poiſe one another, and by that produce a New Ballance? To this Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> gives a Solution in the <note place="margin">H. p. 22.</note> Negative, by ſaying that <hi>No one Government whatſoever hath any more then One of two Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances; That of Land which is Nationall, or that of Arms which is Provinciall.</hi> I might without Prejudice to my Cauſe abſtain from any further Diſcuſſion of this Queſtion, for coming juſt now from digging up the Roots of the Doctrine of the Ballance, theſe Branches of it muſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wither and fall off. Yet to ſhow that I did not at firſt without Reaſon propoſe the Queſtion, this ſhall be added in Explication of it.</p>
               <p>There is ſcarſe any one of the Conſiderable Dominions of <hi>Europe</hi> which is not (like a rich Fur compoſed of Tips of Sables) made up of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43887:30"/> ſeverall Pieces; <hi>Spain</hi> conſiſts of the Crowns of <hi>Caſtile, Arragon, Navarre</hi> and <hi>Granada,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides divers Kingdomes Iſlands and Provinces in diſtant Parts of the World: <hi>France,</hi> though it looks like an entire Piece, is conſtituted by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Provinces which have by various Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions come to be united in that Potent King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: In <hi>Spain</hi> the power of the <hi>Castilian</hi> Kings was more abſolute then that of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goneſe;</hi> In <hi>France</hi> ſome of the Provinces retain Priviledges not injoyed by the reſt, as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Aſſembling their particular Eſtates, and the like. The Conſiderer, to prove the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Ballance, made Inſtance in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Arragon,</hi> where ſince the Union with <hi>Castile,</hi> the Regall Power is very much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, And yet without reducing it to a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Ballance, ſeeing <hi>Arragon</hi> is ſtill, as to the maine, governed by their own Lawes, and by their own Officers, and not by an Army. This Inſtance is rejected by Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> becauſe the Ballance both in <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Aragon</hi> being that of a Nobility, They both, ſaies He, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue Nationall. I am deſirous of giving him all faire Satisfaction, and therefore am Content to lay aſide this Inſtance, and inſtead of it fix up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on One in <hi>France</hi> which is not liable to the ſame Objection, And this ſhall be the Imperiall Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Metz, Thoul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun.</hi> Theſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were free Members of the Empire, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the way of a Republique by their own Citizens, as <hi>Strasbourg</hi> and other Imperiall Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are at this day, and by Conſequence their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43887:31"/> Ballance muſt neceſſarily have been Popular: They were ſomewhat more then an hundred yeares agoe ſurprized by the French, who have ſince incorporated them into the Crown, the Ballance of which is by a Nobility; And the laſt King of <hi>France</hi> erected a Parliament there, after the manner of the other Members of that Crown.</p>
               <p>Now I am to demand of Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> Whether the Ballance in theſe Cities be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Popular, to that by a Nobility? If He affirms it to be changed, We ſhall not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to believe him unleſs He brings Proofs ſtrong enough to overthrow the Vehement Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that We may have for the Contrary, by obſerving that theſe Cities continue ſtill to be of great Traffique, which muſt of Neceſſity keep the Wealth in the People's hands. If He replies that the Ballance of them is Provinciall, It will be very difficult to apprehend the Truth of that Anſwer, ſeeing the Inhabitants of them injoy all the Privileges of French Subjects, and are governed by the ſame Lawes, and the ſame Forme of Adminiſtration of Juſtice with the reſt of France. Tis true indeed they live under the Power of a Governour, but in that They differ not from <hi>Picardie, Champagne, Languedoc</hi> and all other Parts of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whoſe Ballance notwithſtanding is not therefore Provinciall; Nor can it be denied that they have a Garriſon upon them, but in this their Caſe is the ſame with all the Frontire Towns in France, which are ſecured with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43887:31"/> not ſo much out of Jealouſie of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as of a Forreign Enemy.</p>
               <p>If then the Ballance of theſe Cities can neither be ſaid to be the Nationall One of the Crown they live under, nor yet Provinciall, I had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to put the Queſtion, Whether there might not be a Mixture of the Nationall and Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Ballance, or a poiſing of one another by the ſeverall Parts of an Empire. Of which We may with facility obtain this farther Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That as the pretended force of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in any one Countrey, ſecures the Power in the Hands of ſuch Perſons on whoſe ſide the Ballance is, So in the Union of ſeverall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys under One Empire, the Power remains with thoſe to whom the Ballance reſulting from the whole belongs: And as in one Single Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Men are neceſſitated to ſubmit to the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, becauſe they deſpaire of Power to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, So in the Union of Severall Countreys, Some one of them may be obliged to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Government different from their own Ballance, as knowing themſelves to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed by the Ballance of the Reſt.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IF I had not been taught by Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> himſelf that many Paſſages of his are to be underſtood by way of <hi>Similitude</hi> only, not of <note place="margin">H. p. 9.</note> Argument or Probation, I ſhould have been very much at a loſs how to anſwer this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But now by the help of that Inſtruction I perceive this is intended for a Chapter of <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes,</hi> And it would be too unkind a Part to oppoſe a Gentleman in the choiſe of ſuch <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> as He thinks fit to make uſe of for the adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſtile. I am ſenſible of my having alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy erred in this Point, and juſtly incurred Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Anger, by thinking his <hi>Similitudes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 2.</note> included ſomewhat of Reaſon in them, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall imploy my Care in this Chapter to impart that Caution to the Reader which I my ſelf have received, leaſt He ſhould do theſe <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes</hi> or their Author ſo much wrong as to miſtake them for Reaſons.</p>
               <p>The firſt Place where this Care may be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably imploy'd, is about a <hi>Similitude</hi> which, though it be taken from Beaſts, We are not to expect ſhould have foure Feet. <hi>Divers of the Beaſts</hi> (it is <hi>Grotius</hi> who has obſerved it) <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain

                  <hi>thoſe of the ſame kind, or at leaſt of their Young. Mankind then</hi> (infers Mr <hi>Harrington) muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be leſs juſt then the Creature, or acknowledg alſo his Common Intereſt to be Common Right.</hi> To go about upon this Occaſion to diſcover the Cauſes of that Affection which Brute Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures beare to their Foetus, And how a Part ſeparated from an Animal to which it had been long united may by the Perpetuall ſtream of Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviums emitted from it, continue to have an Operation upon that Animall, would be a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition too remote from our preſent Subject. I will rather make Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> a Gift of the whole Inference, and allow That Men have the ſame Affections with the Creatures, And do deny themſelves their own Profit for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their Familie: But what will He gaine by this Conceſſion? This will at moſt ſerve to prove ſomething of a Common Intereſt of every Familie within it ſelf, but fals infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhort of making out a Common Intereſt of all Mankind; And I do juſtly ſuſpect He will not be much gratified with any Inſtances taken from Paternity, or the naturall Adminiſtration or Intereſts of Families, ſeeing there is not in that whole Oeconomy one Particular, which does not largely disfavour the Pretenſions of Popular Government.</p>
               <p>And therefore He cals in another <hi>Similitude</hi> to the Reſcue, and tels Us out of <hi>Hooker, That even ſtones or heavy things forſake their ordinary mont or Center, and fly upwards, to relieve the</hi>

                  <hi>Diſtreſs of Nature in Common.</hi> If I ſhould now take this Hint to diſcourſe of <hi>Vacuum Diſſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum,</hi> of Magneticall Motion, of the Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Impulſion of Aire, of the Protruſion of leſs heavy Bodies by thoſe that are more Heavy, and of ſeverall other Principles belonging to this Subject, Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> would think Me very Fond of my Naturall Philoſophie, and more then ordinarily Covetous of an Occaſion to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge it. It is enough that this is but a <hi>Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and as ſuch did very well become Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> in a Rhetoricall Exaggeration, Nor ſhall Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> be denied the ſame Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty while He appeares either as Poet or Orator, but when He acts the Legiſlator's Part, and pretends to fix the Principles of Government, He muſt not wonder if We remain unſatisfied with ſuch thin Diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>Indeed He himſelf ſeems to place no great Confidence in them, but has thought fit to <note place="margin">H. p. 25.</note> give Us this <hi>farther Demonſtration: All Civill Lawes acknowledge that there is a Common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Mankind, and all Civill Lawes proceed from the Nature of Man, therefore it is in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man to acknowledge that there is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Intereſt of Mankind.</hi> How? Do all Civill Lawes proceed from the Nature of Man? This New Maxime will make ſtrange Havock among the pore <hi>School-men</hi> and Authors <hi>de Legibus,</hi> and quite Ruine all their Diviſions and Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Jus Naturale, Jus Gentium,</hi> and <hi>Jus Civile;</hi> But of all Men honeſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſpian</hi> will be in the worſt Condition who has had the ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43887:33"/> to give us this Account of Civill Lawes; <hi>Jus Civile eſt quod neque in totum à Naturali</hi>

                  <hi>vel Gentium recedit, nec per omnia ei ſervit: Itaque cum aliquid addimus vel detrahimus juri communi, Jus proprium, id eſt Civile efficimus.</hi> Which is beyond Diſpute thus far true, That the Obligation of Civill Lawes conſiſts proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuch Things to which Men were not bound by Nature, nor by any other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but their Subjection to the Power which conſtitutes thoſe Lawes; For otherwiſe the ſame Civill Lawes muſt obtain through the whole World, ſeeing all Men are equally bound to what proceeds from Nature: But though Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Aſſertion were true, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderer were not at all concerned in it, For He at firſt denying there was any Common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Mankind, only with Reference to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind before they had voluntarily liſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Societies, and ſo rendred themſelves Subject to Civill Lawes, is not now with any Equity to be oppugned by any Obſervations taken from the Condition of Mankind after it was become Subject to the Power of Civill Lawes. I muſt alwaies aſſert, That though O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally in the State of Nature, and Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to all Society, there was no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Intereſt of Mankind diſtinct from the Parts taken ſeverally; (the Obligation laid upon Families by Paternall Power only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) but that every particular Man had Right to proſecute his own Advantage, though to the Ruine of other Men, yet ſince the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43887:34"/> of Government, Men are obliged beſides, nay in many Caſes above, their own Private Intereſt, to advance the Publique or Common One: The reaſon of which is taken from hence, That unleſs Every private Man does deveſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his private Intereſt as well as his private Power, and contribute it to the Publique, the Sovereign Power will be diſabled from effecting the Deſign and Aime of Government; And Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Men will in vain expect from that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which has by themſelves been ſo unwiſely limited, Protection and the Benefit of Lawes: By this Protection and Benefit of Lawes, Every Man's Power and Intereſt which He had parted with, comes home to him again with Increaſe, the Obſervation of ſuch Lawes as the Sovereign Power finds uſefull for the Preſervation of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety being in an Eminent Manner the Intereſt of every private Man: For Inſtance, <hi>A man that Steales is put to Death;</hi> This is not only the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Intereſt, but the Private Intereſt of every Particular Man, who by the Terrour of ſuch a Puniſhment is in ſome Meaſure ſecured from an Invaſion on his Propriety. This Aſſertion is I confeſſe contradictory to Mr <hi>Harrington's, That a Man who ſteales is not put to Death for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>any Man's private Intereſt,</hi> in which, as in this whole Thing called Demonſtration, I meet with ſo little Reaſon, that it pities Me there is nothing in it which might make it paſs for a <hi>Similitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing then the Addreſſes of <hi>Reaſon</hi> have been ſo unſucceſſefull, I do not wonder to find
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43887:34"/> 
                  <hi>The other Potent Rivall Paſſion,</hi> has obtained ſo far upon Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Soule. He pretends <hi>That the whole Philoſophie of the Soule which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Policy is demonſtrated throughout the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of Oceana, And that it conſiſts in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Paſſion and advancing Reaſon unto the Throne of Empire.</hi> But it will not be Rationall to believe this of a Commonwealth whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Legiſlator is himſelf a ſlave of Paſſion, and not a Subject of Reaſon; And I make my Appeale to all unintereſſed Perſons, Whether through his whole Reply Reaſon or Paſſion beare the greateſt ſway with Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> And in reference to this particular Chapter, I deſire them to Judge, Whether it be not an heap of very Pitifull Petulancies and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Yet it is not to be thought but that in this Anger He has Wit, of which if any Man be unconvinced, He is to be remitted to that admirable Oration He makes to the two <hi>Girles,</hi> which being a Treaſury of ſuch Rare Conceits, ought in all Prudence to be inſerted with the other Speeches into the following Editions of <hi>Oceana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though his Wit be admirable, his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion ſtill has the upper hand; To repeat 40 or 50 lines out of his Commonwealth of <hi>Ocea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> was not very troubleſome, but to examine the Reaſons alledged by the Conſiderer to prove that the Caſe of the two Girles dividing and chooſing their Cake was not applicable to the Inſtitution of a Commonwealth, was too ſtubborn a Matter to be wrought to his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43887:35"/> and is therefore ſilently paſt over. It is but Juſtice that I ſhould have leave to repeat too, and put Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> in mind that He goes upon a falſe Suppoſition; For unleſs the two Girles lived under ſome Power grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then their own, (And if ſo they were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſome Society, and obliged in Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their Cake to behave themſelves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the eſtabliſht Lawes of it) They would never have divided the Cake, but the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the two Girles would have taken the whole, or at leaſt ſo much of it as She thought uſefull to her.</p>
               <p>In like Manner, If ſome One Perſon or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have acquired the Supream Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (by what Method or Artifice is not as to this purpoſe Materiall) ſhall think fit to frame a Government where the whole People ſhall be divided into two Aſſemblies, with one of which ſhall be the right of dividing or Deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and with the other that of chooſing or Reſolving, there is no great Reaſon to doubt but that this Temper may be effectuall to the attaining the Ends of Government: Yet even in this Caſe, it will be a Neceſſary Caution, That by mixing the Function of the ſeverall Members of the Government, it be not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered diſputable in which of them the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power reſides, For this deſtroyes the Deſign of Government, and muſt frequently reduce things to the State of War. But all this while this is nothing to Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Purpoſe, and ſerves not at all to make out
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43887:35"/> the Naturall Right of a Commonwealth, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Frame of a Commonwealth depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon ſome former Sovereign Power; And to imagine that without the Influence of ſuch a Power, Men unreduced or broken to the Rules of Society, ſhould of themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive themſelves into two Aſſemblies, One of which ſhould divide and the other chooſe, And that the ſtrongeſt would not rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs the whole Right both of dividing and chooſing, Is to ſuppoſe that which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be granted, And for which I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there can ever be any ſtronger Reaſon produced then Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> bare Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For as for that Notion of a <hi>Naturall Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy and a Naturall Ariſtocracy, Or that among</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>twenty Men there will be ſome few (perhaps Six) excelling the Fourteen in greatneſs of Parts,</hi> It is altogether Arbitrary and deſtitute of any good ground in Experience; Among the twenty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there will be but One, perhaps Sixteen, who excell the Reſt in Parts: Or if this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of about a third be allowed him, it will not be enough to help him over the ſtile; For though among <hi>twenty Men</hi> (not related to one another, nor as yet united in any Society) <hi>Six</hi> be apparently Wiſer then the <hi>Fourteen,</hi> Muſt the <hi>Fourteen</hi> therefore neceſſarily intruſt the <hi>Six</hi> with the Debate of ſuch things as concern their Intereſt? Is it not much more Naturall to every Man to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Wiſe enough to adviſe about his own
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43887:36"/> Affaires, and to ſuſpect all Perſons of a greater Reach then himſelf? Indeed upon a Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that there were any known Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of theſe <hi>twenty</hi> Men, it were not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that ſuch of them as by Experience were known to be the Wiſeſt, might be intruſted by the Reſt with their Common Affaires; But it has been already demonſtrated that there can be no ſuch Common Intereſt ( I adde now alſo, Nor no ſuch Experience of one another's Abilities) unleſs thoſe <hi>twenty</hi> Men had been before united in ſome Society, that is, reduced under ſome Government. Wherefore Mr <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> ſtands Convict of Obſtinacy in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralogiſme, That He by Suppoſition puts the <hi>twenty</hi> Men into a Condition that of Neceſſity infers them to be already reduced to ſome Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, And yet at the ſame time Imagines them free to diſpoſe of themſelves as if They lived under no Government, and did but then begin to think of Conſtituting One.</p>
               <p>To go yet a little farther with him, Admit that at firſt by ſome ſtrange Accident a People ſhould happen thus to diſtribute themſelves into two Aſſemblies, a dividing One, or <hi>Senate,</hi> and a chooſing One or <hi>Popular Aſſembly:</hi> Is this Foundation firm enough to ſuſtain the whole Weight of a Commonwealth? May not either of theſe Aſſemblies repent of the Bargain, and indeavour to draw the whole Power both of the Debate and Reſult to themſelves? That the <hi>Senate</hi> may do it by deluding the <hi>People,</hi> and confounding their Judgments in the Choice or
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43887:36"/> Reſult ſeems not improbable; Nor is it Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote enough to ſay that <hi>The People in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth are their own Army,</hi> unleſs it were alſo Certain that a more ſubtle Party never had nor could diſpoſſeſs a ſimple and ignorant One of the Power of the Sword. But that on the other ſide the <hi>People</hi> ſhould not invade the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Senate</hi> and take upon themſelves the Right of Debate as well as of the Reſult, can not without ſome ſhame be denied by him who has complained of the <hi>Athenian, Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> People for this very thing. It is true None of theſe <hi>People</hi> did go about to take away the <hi>Senate</hi> wholly, but the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is not great between diſſolving an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and rendring it altogether Inſignificant by robbing it of that Employment for which it was at firſt Inſtituted. When the Lion is to chooſe, the Fox knows his Diviſion muſt be ſuch as gives all to One ſide and leaves nothing to the other; If a <hi>People</hi> be once inraged, the <hi>Senate</hi> will find themſelves concerned to pleaſe them in the Diviſion as well as in the Choice. And this was the Condition of the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Capua</hi> after the Fright they were put into by <hi>Pacuvius, I am verò nihil in Senatu actum aliter, quàm ſi Plebis ibi eſſet Conſilium.</hi> That whole <note place="margin">Liv.</note> Scene was laid by <hi>Pacuvius</hi> with a Deſign to preſerve the <hi>Senators</hi> and ſatisfie the <hi>People,</hi> and by that at once bring them both into a Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon himſelf; His ſurprize of the <hi>People</hi> was indeed very Ingenious, but had He given them time to conſider, They would without
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43887:37"/> doubt have found out ſome among themſelves whom They would have thought Wiſe enough to make a <hi>Senate:</hi> If not, It muſt have been for want of Inſtruction in Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>That the pretended Depth and Difficulty</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 133.</note> 
                  <hi>in Matter of State is a meere Cheat. From the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World unto this day, you never found a Commonwealth, where the Leaders having Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty enough, wanted skill enough to lead her unto her true Intereſt at home or abroad.</hi>

               <p>By this it appeares, That there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Right or Intereſt of Mankind (except that of Families ariſing from Paternall Power) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to the Reduction of Mankind under Government; As alſo, That the Office of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding, or debating, and Chooſing or Reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Or the different Functions of the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>People</hi> in a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> are not founded upon any Naturall Right, but meerly upon an Artificiall One proceeding from the Deſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome preceding Sovereign Power. And this being the true Caſe of a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> the two diſtinct Aſſemblies of the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>People</hi> have not as to this any more advantage then is between any Parties who give and take Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; Counſell is nothing but Ratiocination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Affaires of another Man, and Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination is the Addition or Subtraction of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; The Operation belongs to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who gives Counſell, and the Proof or <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of it remains in his hand who receives the Counſell: This Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> is pleaſed to call dividing and chooſing, which in this Sence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43887:37"/> to a <hi>Monarchy</hi> as much as to a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;</hi> For when a Prince askes any Man his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe (and I think there never was Prince who adviſed not with ſome Body) that Man divides, and the Prince makes the Choiſe; Only here is the Difference, an able Prince if his Counſell has committed an Error in the Operation knows both how to detect and Rectifie it, but a <hi>Popular Aſſembly</hi> being of themſelves unfit for a Debate, are forced to acquieſce in the Diviſion or Debate of the <hi>Senate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what if after all the <hi>Popular Aſſembly,</hi> fixes upon the wrong Member of the Diviſion? To judge of the Utility or Diſutility of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in matter of State, is I hope another thing from diſcerning which is the biggeſt or leaſt Piece of a Cake, And a Diſcourſe about which much of underſtanding and Experience muſt be imployed, is not of ſo eaſy and certain Diſpatch, as a Matter which is ſubmitted to the Determination of ſenſe. In one reſpect, the Choiſe or Reſult is an Action of greater Difficulty then the Diviſion or Debate, For an Active Fancie which ſuddenly Ranges over a great deale of ground, may eaſily find out the various Methods of which any Buſineſs is Capable, but to diſcern which of them is the moſt conducing, is the Work of an exact and well-poiſed Judgment.

               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all that has been ſaid, it muſt be confeſſed that a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> gaines one great Advantage by the Debate of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;</hi> For the <hi>People</hi> being compoſed of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Obſtinacy, and Tumult would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Moment teare to pieces any Buſineſs that ſhould be thrown among them; Whereas by reſerving the Debate to the <hi>Senate,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> have no other imployment but to let fall a little piece of Linnen at all Adventures into one of two Boxes, So that being thus brought within a Disjunction of the Matter, It can be but an even lay againſt them that they do Miſcarry.</p>

               <p>I need not conceale that Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> in this Point walkes in a Path traced out for him by <hi>Hotoman;</hi> Who indeed accuſes <hi>Tribo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> of Error or Aſſentation, And ſaies that the <hi>Senatuſconſulta</hi> had not the Power of <hi>Lawes</hi> before it was given them by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, who by that thought to fortifie the Power they had uſurped over the <hi>People.</hi> But We muſt be cautious in admitting <hi>Hotoman's</hi> Judgment in theſe Matters; For He was
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43887:40"/> not only a profeſſed Condemner of <hi>Tribonian's</hi> Labours in compiling that Body of Civill Law which is at preſent extant in the World, but having been during the Civill Wars of <hi>France</hi> ingaged in a Popular Faction, He acquired there ſome Bitterneſs of Spirit againſt Kings, which He frequently diſcovers in his Writings. If it be <hi>Hotoman's</hi> Authority which muſt beare Me down in this Point, I ſhall cover my ſelf with the Authority of <hi>Cujacius, Connanus, Rivallius, Tholoſanus, Gothofred, Calvin, Schardius,</hi> and the whole ſtream of Interpreters who run on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide: If <hi>Hotoman's</hi> Arguments are thought ſtrong enough to carry it, I muſt deſire they may be examined, and then they will appeare to prove no more then this, That whereas <hi>Caeſar</hi> had left the Election of halfe the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, with ſome other ſmall Remaines of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the <hi>Peoples</hi> hands, <hi>Tiberius</hi> transferred all to the <hi>Senate:</hi> Which is ſo far from making good his Aſſertion, that it is a ſtrong Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Contrary, Seeing it is not likely that by ſuch an Innovation in Favour of the <hi>Senate, Tiberius</hi> would have incurred the Diſcontent of the <hi>People,</hi> if they had not been habituated in other Caſes to ſee ſuch Power in the <hi>Senate's</hi> Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>It was not then by any new Power conferred by the <hi>Emperours,</hi> but only by their Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to retain an Antient One, that the Decrees of the <hi>Roman Senate</hi> had the Power of <hi>Lawes,</hi> and as ſuch found place in the Compilement of the Roman Lawes by <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> That the

               </p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> was told by the Conſiderer, That if there appeares to have been a more then Ordinary Calm in the ſtate of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> this was not ſo much to be attributed to the Form of their Government, as to their ſevere Education and affected Poverty, by which all things that ſerved as Baits to Sedition, were driven out of the Country: So that it can not be Rationall to expect the ſame Effects from the ſame Government, where the ſame Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and manner of Life is wanting. Since He has been content to ſpare himſelf the Pains of taking Notice of this, I ſhall ſuppoſe it does not ſtand in need of any farther Elucidation, unleſs perhaps in the Diſcovery of the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian Agrarian</hi> it prove convenient to inſiſt a little upon it.</p>

                  <hi>either to be conſidered as not taking in the Helots, and then ſhe was an equall Commonwealth, or taking them in, and ſo ſhe was unequall.</hi> This is juſt the Man in the Fable who inquired of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43887:42"/> the Oracle, Whether the Sparrow in his Fiſt would come out Dead or alive, when it was in his own Power to make the choiſe; So Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> will have the Power, according as it ſutes with his Occaſions, to make <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemon</hi> an <hi>equall</hi> or an <hi>unequall Commonwealth.</hi> But to make ſhort, If ſhe were an <hi>equall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,</hi> What has He to ſay to the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Helots?</hi> If ſhe were <hi>Unequall,</hi> Why did he play the <hi>Mountebanck</hi> in uſing her as the Example of an <hi>Equall</hi> One?</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſort of Inſtances alledged by Me to prove <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> not to have been free from Seditions, were the Conteſts which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about the Succeſſion to the Crown.

               <p>The Conſiderer brought Inſtances of a third ſort of Seditions in <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> which it ſeems prove not for Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to remember; There is no ſcarſity in Hiſtorie of ſuch Inſtances, and it will not be unſeaſonable to commend a few more of them to his Forgetfulneſs. Firſt the Sedition of thoſe young Men who (Becauſe their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were unmarried Women, ſuch as the ſtate had for greater Population injoyned to make uſe of a Promiſcuous Propagation) were
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43887:43"/> called <hi>Partheniae,</hi> and after they were ſuppreſt <note place="margin">Ariſt. Polit. lib. 5. c. 7.</note> were ſent to inhabit <hi>Tarentum</hi> in <hi>Italie.</hi> Then the Sedition of them who during the <hi>Maſſeniac</hi> War demanded a new Diviſion of the Lands. After that the Attempt of King <hi>Pauſanias</hi> to make himſelf abſolute Maſter of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And then the two dangerous Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies in the Neck of one another during the <hi>Theban</hi> Invaſion, in the firſt of which about 200 diſcontented Perſons had ſeized upon the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Diana,</hi> one of the ſtrongeſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible Quarters of the City, from whence it <note place="margin">Plut. in Ages.</note> would have been very difficult to drive them out, had not <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> by a ſudden Fetch of Wit cheated them out of their Poſt and Reſolution; The ſecond conſiſted of a Caball of <hi>Spartans</hi> of good Quality who had their ſecret Aſſemblies for the Innovating Publique Affaires, And when they were detected, the Senate durſt not bring them to an open Triall, but they were privately executed by the Authority of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> and the <hi>Ephores,</hi> whereas before that time no <hi>Spartan</hi> had ever been put to Death without the due form of Juſtice. Theſe Inſtances being all either older then <hi>Lyſander,</hi> or immediately upon his time, are not liable to any of Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> exceptions, but ſerve abundantly to evince, that <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> has not been exempted from the Fate of all other Commonwealths, but has had her Portion of ſeditions.</p>
               <p>As for the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> though ſhe be poſſeſt of ſeverall Advantages by her ſituation, yet ſhe is not at all beholden to that, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43887:44"/> Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> for her tranquillity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Doores; For ſaies he, <hi>ſhe is like a man in a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>Citadel who thereby may be the ſafer from his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but nere a whit the ſafer from Diſeaſes.</hi> But before we can allow of this ſimilitude, We muſt deſire him to remember, That as in the Body of man, ſo in a Commonwealth, ſome Diſeaſes are like Feavors cauſed by a Diſorder in the Blood or Humors, others like Plagues are communicated by an Externall Contagion; From the firſt indeed the ſituation of <hi>Venice</hi> gives her not any ſecurity, but againſt the laſt it is a ſovereign Antidote, And of this Familie are the Diſeaſes moſt frequently incident to a State. Of old the <hi>Lacedaemonian &amp; Cretan</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiques ſcarſe differed in their Conſtitution, the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> being but a Copy wrought by <hi>Lycurgus</hi> after the <hi>Cretan</hi> Originall; yet the <hi>Cretans</hi> were never moleſted with any inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of their ſlaves, from which the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> in any the leaſt Publique Adverſity, were rarely free; And the cauſe of this Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty aſſigned by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is, That the <hi>Argives, Meſſenians</hi> and <hi>Arcadians,</hi> all neighbouring States, did continually foment the Diſcontents of the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> ſlaves, But <hi>Crete</hi> being an Iſland, no Enemy was neare enough to tempt their ſlaves to a Defection. In like manner the <hi>Venetian</hi> Republique being comprehended within her Iſlands, ſhe by that ſituation is ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from thoſe Practiſes by which her Enemies might indeavour to excite ſeditions among her ſubjects.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:43887:44"/>
               <p>Though the City of <hi>Venice</hi> it ſelf is ſeated out of the reach of all Enemies, her Frontire extends to two very dangerous Ones, the great <hi>Turk,</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> whoſe known Rapacity obliges her to a great deale of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and Reſervedneſs at home; And though <hi>the Frontires of all ſtates are bounded by the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of other Princes,</hi> Yet all have not ſuch Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Neighbours, againſt whom their whole Care and Power is alwaies neceſſary: Thoſe who have, will in all Probability think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerned not to weaken their Force by any Domeſtick Tumults, there being nothing more Naturall then That the Feare of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy ſhould preſerve Union and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between Friends. This Truth is obſerved to have been very Operative with the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were not overrun with the Seditions of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> before that by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the emulous Power of <hi>Carthage,</hi> They were freed from the Feare and Danger of any Common Enemy.</p>
               <p>If I produced Examples of Seditions at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi> which are older then the laſt <hi>Reiglement</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 40.</note> (this Word was thought no bad Engliſh by the Lord <hi>Bacon)</hi> in the time of <hi>Piero Gradenigo,</hi> I made Uſe of my juſt Liberty, Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> having not any where put in a Bar againſt ſuch Examples: Yet now that He has reſtrained the Inquiry within the Compaſs of that Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am willing to omit the Mutiny upon Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the new Impoſitions in Duke <hi>Rinieri Zeno's</hi> time, with all other examples which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43887:45"/> might be added of Seditions before the Reign of <hi>Gradenigo.</hi> And if the Matter be thus ſtated, What hurt if We grant him all that He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? That in the whole World, through the courſe of all Ages, there may be found one Commonwealth, which by the help of thoſe concurring cauſes already mentioned, has for ſomething above 300 yeares been free from <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi> Is this that Giant Argument which muſt extirpate Monarchicall Government out of the World, and in ſpite of Fate reduce Us all to a Commonwealth?</p>
               <p>Yet even this Liberality is more then Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> can with Honeſty receive, as long as the Actions of <hi>Bocconi, Tiepoli,</hi> and <hi>Faliero,</hi> manifeſt that <hi>Venice</hi> has been diſturbed with Seditions even ſince her laſt Reformation. He indeavours indeed to perſwade that thoſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do not imply any Sedition in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; For ſaies He, <hi>Bocconi would have killed the Duke and was hanged before he could do it,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>Felton did kill a Duke and was hanged after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi> Under favour the Caſes are not at all alike; <hi>Felton</hi> (though perhaps animated by zeale) killed the Duke upon a private Revenge; <hi>Bocconi</hi> went about to kill the Duke that he might afterward change the Government; <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> made uſe of no other aſſiſtance but his own Arm, <hi>Bocconi</hi> engaged many Complices. If We would find a Parallel in the <hi>Venetian</hi> ſtorie for <hi>Felton's</hi> Aſſaſſinate, We muſt not take <hi>Bocconi,</hi> but <hi>Andrea Contarini,</hi> who being repulſed in his ſute for an Employment, grew into that

But this being only the Iſſue of a private Quarrell, He does not find Me making any Advantage of it, <hi>Faliero and his Complices,</hi> continueth He, <hi>would have deſtroyed the great Councell, but were hanged before they could do it, Vaux and his Accomplices would have blown up the Parliament but were hanged before they could do it; Therefore England was in this Relation a Seditious Government, elſe why was Venice?</hi> I do not know that the Conſiderer ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to prove that the Government of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was alwaies free from Seditions; If He had, that One Inſtance of the <hi>Powder Treaſon</hi> had been enough to confute Him. Such attempts, as they are of a more dangerous Nature, ſo they deſerve a Name of more Horror, then Seditions: For Seditions, like ſtorms gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a far of, give ſome warning before They fall, There is Roome for Prudence to ſeek ſome way to divert them, The Interpoſition of Moderate and Acceptable Perſons does of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten prevent or ſoon pacifie them, At worſt their Fury may be avoided by a ſpeedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; But theſe ſecret Conſpiracies, like vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſubterraneous Eruptions, in a Moment deſtroy all, And if they be not diſcovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Execution (which no ſtate be it either a Monarchy or Republique can

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43887:46"/> prove, <hi>That an equall Commonwealth</hi> (of which he produced <hi>Venice</hi> as an Example) <hi>had no flaw in it, and was ſuch as No Man could have the Intereſt or Power to diſturb with Sedition.</hi> Of this He has not performed the leaſt part, but indeavours to put Us of with an impertinent Nicety about the Notation of the Word <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now for what Purpoſe ſerves this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion to ſhut the great Gate of <hi>Sedition,</hi> if ſo many back Doores of Diſorder be left open by which Miſerie and Deſtruction may enter into a Commonwealth? As if it were not all One, if a Man muſt neceſſarily receive a Mortall Wound, Whether it be given him with a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitar or a Penknife. Beſides all this Mr <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> beſtows a large Fallacie upon Us in the Application of this Example: For if the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Venice</hi> from <hi>Seditions</hi> be only to be underſtood in reference to the Agreement of the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana</hi> is like to gain very little Credit or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity from it; In <hi>Venice</hi> the <hi>People</hi> (as We are often told) are the <hi>Grand Counſell,</hi> all of them Men of Noble Extraction and Excellent education, not actually armed, conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding under the view of the Magiſtrates, in number not exceeding three thouſand, ſo that the Publique Employments being very many make ſwift Returns as they circulate through them. In <hi>Oceana</hi> the <hi>People</hi> are no leſſe then two hundred thouſand, having Arms in their hand, made up of Men of all Ranks and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, inhabiting the face of a wide-ſpread
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43887:47"/> Countrey, and few of them having Rationall hopes to attain any Conſiderable Magiſtracy. Let any Man weigh the Oppoſitions in the Temper of theſe Commonwealths, and then judge whether there can be any good Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence made from the Quietneſs of the One to the ſtability of the other. To Me the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence lookes like that of the Young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who becauſe he had never ſeen a ſtorm upon his Father's Fiſh-pond, concluded there could not be any upon the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>But though all what has been ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> ſhould be admitted, Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> is ſtill ſecure; At moſt He can but looſe a brace of Examples, and be put to ſay (as He does of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Genua</hi> in a like Caſe) that if <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> have been diſturbed with <hi>Seditions,</hi> then they alſo muſt have been unequall Commonwealths: For in <note place="margin">H. p. 46.</note> generall it is moſt certain, <hi>That a Government which attains to perfect equality hath ſuch a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration in the Frame of it, that No man in or under it can contract ſuch Intereſt or Power, as ſhould be able to diſturb the Commonwealth with</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Sedition. And the whole Commonwealth of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceana being the Exemplification of ſuch an equall Government,</hi> If Men are ſtill to ſeek for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth that has been free from <hi>Seditions,</hi> the Fault is their own that they make no more haſt to come under ſo happy a Government. This then is a ſtate of the Queſtion which ought to be determin'd by Experiment rather then Argument; But the Ingredients to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43887:47"/> (the ſafety of three Nations) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of two great Expenſe, We are obliged to better Husbandry, and muſt be content to make our Judgment of the future Succeſſes of this Government by the Paper Modell of it which has been given Us, And examine Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that contains any Security, that this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has no Poſſibility of being diſturbed with <hi>Sedition:</hi> The Truth or Falſehood of which Propoſition will beſt be diſcovered, by referring the particular Frame of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Oceana,</hi> to the Generall Idea of <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apprehenſion of a Diſability in every particular Man (or at leaſt in every particular Familie) of preſerving by his own ſingle Power either his Life or any thing uſefull to life, was the firſt inducement of Mankind to come under <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> Now it was impoſſible to eſtabliſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Government</hi> without a <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in ſome One Man or Aſſembly of Men, For without that Every particular Man muſt ſtill have been left to the Protection of his own ſtrength, and muſt have continued to do all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men whatſoever Miſchief did any way conduce to his own Profit or Preſervation, the avoiding the Inconveniences of which Life was that which Men intended by ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Government;</hi> And therefore every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Man was neceſſitated to part with his Native Power and intruſt it with the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi> whoſe Actions He did thereby Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and make his own. The Sovereignty being
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43887:48"/> thus fixt, The next work was to enact Lawes, or preſcribe Rules of behaviour both in Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Service to himſelf which the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> thought fit to require, and the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe or Commerce between every Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Man united under him. But here it ſoon began to appear how irregular the Paſſions of Man are, and how infirm and Erroneous his Diſcourſe, For Men preſently indeavoured to reſume the Liberty which They had ſo lately parted with, and violated thoſe Lawes which had been newly Authoriſed by themſelves. Yet the Inconvenience was not great, as long as this Irregularity exceeded not a few Perſons, ſuch as were apparently too weak to reſiſt the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power; For then theſe Offences, as Murder, Theft, and the like, were preſently attended by the Puniſhments ordained for them by the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and the Facinorous Perſons being made Examples of Juſtice; ſerved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain other Men within the Bounds of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>But if the Number of thoſe who were Deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to reſume the Power they had parted with, or who otherwiſe by reaſon of their Crimes were concerned that the Courſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhould be intercepted, did at any time prove great enough to beare up againſt the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> Power, Then were Matters reduced again to a Condition of War, and <hi>Government</hi> with all the Pacts on which it had been found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed trampled under Foot. It may ſeem contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Reaſon that the Motives which were at
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43887:48"/> firſt ſtrong enough to make Men ſubmit to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> and Lawes, ſhould afterward prove too weake to inforce their Obedience to them; And without doubt if Men did in all their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions govern themſelves by Calm and ſolid Reaſon, They would never hearken ſo far ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſtimulations of their own Paſſions, or to the Incitements of other Men, as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a Deſign of reverſing the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power, For the greateſt Miſchiefs that can be ſuffered by any <hi>Government,</hi> are not compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thoſe Occaſioned by the Abſence of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> when Men live in the Wild and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs condition of War, Nor can it be any thing but Madneſs voluntarily to expoſe ones ſelf to Miſerie for the taking away a Power, in room of which another equall Power muſt of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be ſubſtituted. Yet Experience teaches Us that this is too little to make the World Wiſe, at which We ought no more to wonder, then that the Certainty of Puniſhment ſhould not be enough to make men abſtain from violating Lawes, Nor the Feare of Hell Torments (even to thoſe who are ſufficiently perſwaded of the Certitude of them) to keep Men from ſinning. So that the Wiſedome of thoſe Men is a little to be ſuſpected, who think any Governours can be ſecured, by the unreaſonableneſs that would be in their Subjects Diſobedience; For there ever were and will eternally be ſome Men who will miſtake in this Point, and think it their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to ſubvert the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power.</p>
               <p>This Falſe Opinion has been very much helpt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43887:49"/> forward by the Senſe of thoſe Preſſures which are ſometimes ſuſtain'd under <hi>Government;</hi> For whilſt Men conſidering only their private Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity expect to live free from all Incommodity, They uſually charge the <hi>Government</hi> with thoſe Grievances which are inſeperable from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Condition of Humanity, or perhaps are Conſequences of their own Inconformity to the true and Neceſſary temper of Subjection; There being nothing which Men more Naturally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, Then that the Exerciſe of <hi>Sovereign</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er requires a large Expence, toward which it is neceſſary for every particular Man to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute a Part, thereby to ſecure the Reſt to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Yet it can not be denied That ſometimes there has been much of Iniquity in the Manage of <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power; At firſt, it is likely, the Perſon or Aſſembly truſted with it were known to be of juſt and Generous Principles, but by Succeſſion the <hi>Power</hi> being devolved upon Men Weak or Vitious, They have frequently trifled away the Lives, Honours, and Fortunes of their Subjects, which They ought not to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed but upon juſt and Probable Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Deſire to prevent this Inconvenience brought forth an Expedient into the World, commonly known under the Name of mixt Government, in which, Though there ſeem to be a <hi>Sovereign</hi> Inſtituted, the <hi>People</hi> do not part with their whole Power to him, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome Part of it in their own Hands; So as to ſome Actions in which the Lives and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43887:49"/> Fortunes of every particular Man ſeem moſt concerned (ſuch are the making Lawes and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Mony, and the like) the <hi>Sovereign</hi> in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance can do nothing by himſelf, but the Conſent of the <hi>People</hi> by their Collective or Repreſentative Body is ſtill neceſſary. But this Expedient (though in ſome Places it might be for a while by reaſon of ſome externall Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents not unproſperous) fell ſhort of effecting the thing deſired, And had beſides this irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Breach in it, That while the Perſons to whom the ſeverall Parts of <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> were thus committed, fell into little Jealouſies and Conteſts about their ſeverall Reſpective Rights and Privileges, the Government was weakened, and left as it were without Legs or Arms; And when theſe little Jealouſies came to be improved into open Diſſenſions, the ſeverall Parties aſſuming to themſelves the Exerciſe of the whole <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> and the Advantages remaining with either not being conſpicuous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to determine the Matter otherwaies, the Nation which happened to be the Seat of ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate a Controverſie was neceſſarily redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a State of War; From which it has ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome been known to have been redeemed, but by deſtroying that Mixture which was preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, and rendring one of the Parties abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in their Power.</p>
               <p>Beyond this I know but of One Artefice to which Humane Invention has pretended, and that is to contrive a way how the People may govern themſelves without Inſtituting any <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:43887:50"/> ſo that the Ends of <hi>Government</hi> may be attained and yet no Man deveſt himſelf of his Native Power and Liberty. It is confeſt by thoſe Men who indeavour to introduce this kind of <hi>Government,</hi> that the <hi>People</hi> in their diffuſed condition are incapable of all <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> ignorant of ſuch Counſels as are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their Preſervation, and unable to put the leaſt part of them in Execution: Therefore it is of Neceſſity that the <hi>People</hi> ſhould be aſſembled together, that there ſhould be a <hi>Senate</hi> to conſult, and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to Execute. But the advantage of this <hi>Government</hi> is pretended to conſiſt in this, That the <hi>People</hi> not parting with their Power, but reſerving to themſelves the laſt Reſult in all Buſineſs, They are ſecured from all Injurie and Oppreſſion, ſeeing the <hi>People</hi> can not be ſuppoſed to agree to do themſelves Hurt: And as for the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Senate</hi> they can not be Authors of any Violence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall have only a very limited Power, the Exerciſe of which alſo is terminated within the Compaſs of a few Months, after which they are againe to be melted down into the Maſs of the <hi>People,</hi> from which They were at firſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated. In Fabricating this great Engine, and contriving all the Movements and Reſſorts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it conſiſts the whole Myſterie of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Government;</hi> Of which the moſt perfect Modell, that ever was produced Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> aſſures Us is his Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana.</hi> So that we need only to examine that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth by the Notions &amp; Maximes already laid
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43887:50"/> down, to know Whether Popular <hi>Government</hi> has that advantage over all other <hi>Governments,</hi> as to have no Flaw in it, and not to be expoſed to a Poſſibility of being diſturbed with <hi>Sedition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt Place it is manifeſt that Popular <hi>Government</hi> is equally with any other <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> expoſed to this Inconvenience; That Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Men will have an Intereſt to diſturb it with <hi>Sedition;</hi> For it being impoſſible there ſhould be any <hi>Government</hi> without Lawes, and all Lawes conſiſting either in a Prohibition of doing ſomewhat which before it was free to do, or in a Command of doing ſomewhat which before might have been omitted, Men muſt under Popular <hi>Government</hi> alſo needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret the loſs of that Liberty which was Naturall to them. If it be objected that under Popular <hi>Government</hi> Men give their Conſent to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting of all Lawes, and therefore can not be rationally thought averſe from what was their own Act, It muſt be remembred that in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Government</hi> alſo, every Man did by that One Generall Act of reſigning his Power and Authoriſing the Actions of the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> give his Conſent to all the eſtabliſht Laws, which notwithſtanding is known to be inſufficient for inforcing a Plenary Obedience to Lawes. And it is little leſs then ridiculous to think, That when under Popular <hi>Government</hi> Men have committed ſuch Crimes as by the Lawes of it deſerve Death, They ſhould not apprehend it to be their Intereſt, by diſturbing the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> with <hi>Sedition</hi> to ſecure, if it be poſſible,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43887:51"/> their own Lives. Whenſoever therefore under Popular <hi>Government,</hi> the number of thoſe whoſe offences have rendered them lyable to the ſeverity of Laws, is conſiderable enough to qualify them for the Attempt, Popular <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> has no more ſecurity than any other of being free from <hi>Seditions.</hi> Of this Originall and Extraction as to the main, was <hi>Catalines</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Conſtitution of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Oceana</hi> ſuppoſing a <hi>Senate</hi> and a <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> called the <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Tribe,</hi> conſiſting of about thirteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men, I aske Whether that <hi>Repreſentative</hi> (taking the <hi>Senate</hi> and preſent <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> with it) be indued with the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power, that is ſuch as cannot be reſiſted by any Man or Men within the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana?</hi> If they have ſuch Power, Then it is manifeſt They may whenſoever they think it their Intereſt, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate this power, and by repealing the Orders of <hi>Rotation,</hi> render themſelves a ſtanding <hi>Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> which daſhes to peeces the whole frame of popular <hi>Government,</hi> and puts the publique Affaires (which is contrary to the Deſigne and ſuppoſition of a free Commonwealth) into the hands of a <hi>Sovereign Aſsembly.</hi> Now that the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> may come to think this their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is manifeſt alſo; For the Deſire of <hi>Power</hi> being Naturall to man, a far greater ſhare of <hi>Power</hi> remaines with every particular Man, when the <hi>Svereign Power</hi> is divided among thirteen hundred, then when the ſame <hi>Power</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:43887:51"/> is divided among two hundred thouſand men. It is very true, as Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> has obſerved <hi>That the Power or Effect of a greater People is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. pag. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>proportionably greater then the Power or Effect of a leſſer people;</hi> But that is not to be brought to account under this Head, For it is not now inquired, Whether the <hi>Power</hi> of thirteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or two hundred thouſand Men be greater, but Whether if the ſame <hi>Power</hi> belong to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred or two hundred thouſand men, Every particular perſon of the thirteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred will not have more <hi>Power</hi> than every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon of the two hundred thouſand men. And what has been ſaid of <hi>Power</hi> the ſame is to be underſtood of Riches. So that in the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana,</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrates, Senate,</hi> and <hi>Prerogative Tribe</hi> for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have both power and Intereſt to diſſolve the Frame of the Goverment. And that a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative</hi> is not incapable of making ſuch an attempt as this, will, (it is not improbable) ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily find Belief with thoſe who are acquainted with the Actions of theſe laſt eighteen yeares.</p>
               <p>But now let us reſume the other member of the Disjunction, and ſuppoſe that the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, Senate</hi> and <hi>Prerogative Tribe,</hi> have not the <hi>Sovereign</hi> power, but that it remaines ſtill with the Body of the <hi>People in Oceana.</hi> Hence it muſt follow that in the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana</hi> there is no <hi>Sovereign</hi> power at all, And that the <hi>People</hi> of it are either in a Condition of <hi>Warr,</hi> or ready to fall into it. For the <hi>people of Oceana</hi> being too numerous and too much
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43887:52"/> diſperſed to Aſſemble Perſonally in one place, They cannot concur to any Act but by their <hi>Repreſentative;</hi> But that <hi>Repreſentative</hi> not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Sovereign</hi> power, there is not any ſuch Power conſtituted, and conſequently every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Man is left to the Protection of his own Power and ſtrength, which is the Condition of <hi>War,</hi> and implies the Abſence of all <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will, perhaps, be replied that the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power reſides in the leſſer Aſſemblies, as the Pariſh, Hundred, or Tribe, where the <hi>People</hi> perſonally concur to the Election of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties: But this is not to make One but a great many <hi>Sovereign</hi> Powers, and to ſhatter One great Commonwealth, into as many little Ones as there are Pariſhes in <hi>Oceana.</hi> Nor is the Difficulty removed by it, For theſe leſſer <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> Aſſemblies being not put into any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of concurring in any Common Opinion, but by the Deputies they ſend to the <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi> or <hi>Prerogative Tribe,</hi> If thoſe Deputies be ſent with <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth relapſes into the Danger before inſiſted on of being ſupplanted by that <hi>Repreſentative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if theſe Deputies be not ſent to the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Tribe</hi> with <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power, then the <hi>Prerogative Tribe</hi> has no ſuch Power and by Conſequence can not make Lawes, or impoſe any other Reſolution upon the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; If notwithſtanding this the <hi>Preragative Tribe</hi> does <hi>de facto</hi> make Lawes, the Authority with which they are armed, is not that of the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> it ſelf, but of the leſſer <hi>Sovereign</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:43887:52"/> Aſſemblies, who in that They do not declare their Diſſent, are preſumed to allow of ſuch things as have been reſolved on by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties. So that upon the Matter, <hi>Oceana,</hi> is not a Single Commonwealth, but a Compund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed One made up by a tacite League of ſo many Commonwealths as there are leſſer <hi>Sovereign</hi> Aſſemblies in <hi>Oceana.</hi> Now the Leagues between <hi>Sovereigns</hi> are of no longer Duration then their Common Intereſt, which whenſoever it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be divided, ſuch Leagues Vaniſh; And therefore whenſoever the leſſer <hi>Sovereign</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in <hi>Oceana</hi> come to be divided in their Intereſt, the Commonwealth muſt fall in Pieces. But that They may come to be ſo divided is probable, if not neceſſary; Antiently They were divided both in reſpect of the <hi>Saxon Heptar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,</hi> and the <hi>Welch</hi> Princes under the <hi>Norman</hi> Kings; The difference of Language (One of the greateſt ſeparators of Men's Affections) is not quite worn out; The inhabiting the ſame Iſland is not a ſufficient Argument of Union, for then <hi>Scotland</hi> and We ſhould make but One Nation; In fine, there can be no cauſe aſſigned of the Union of this Nation under One <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> but the Power of former Princes, which by the Inſtitution of this new Commonwealth is quite obliterated. More then all this, The Concernments of the Severall Parts of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are very different in Reference to Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Riches; ſome Parts ſubſiſt upon Mines and Cole, Others upon Manufacture, Some up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Corne, Others upon the Profits of Cattle,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43887:53"/> London and the Sea Ports upon Exportation and Importation; And it is not poſſible but that when thoſe ſeverall things come to be regulated by Lawes, the Different Parts of the Nation muſt neceſſarily eſpouſe very Different Intereſts.</p>
               <p>This is alſo very conformable to Experience; <hi>Greece</hi> was a Country much leſs then <hi>England,</hi> The People of it (with an inconſiderable varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Dialect) ſpoke the ſame Language, They had the ſame Common Enemy the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and were united in many other particular Intereſts: Yet all this was not enough to reduce them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one great Commonwealth, but We find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them almoſt as many Republiques, as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Condition of <hi>Sicilie, Magna Graecia,</hi> and the Coaſts of <hi>Aſia</hi> ſerve alſo to make good the ſame Obſervation. Nay in <hi>Iſrael</hi> (which Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> will have paſs for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth) though the Countrey was ſo Narrow, the People all deſcended of one Familie, and cemented together by a Million of common Concernments and Obligations, this Thing is very apparent alſo; For though it did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a totall Diſſolution of the <hi>Government,</hi> yet It for ſome time ſuſpended it, and threw the People into a Civill <hi>War,</hi> as in the Caſe of <hi>Jeph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah</hi> between the Men of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Gilead,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jud. cap. 12. &amp; 20.</note> and in that of the Levites Concubine, between the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is but One imaginable caſe more to be put concerning the <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Oceana,</hi> Which is, That though the <hi>People</hi> have parted with their Power, They
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43887:53"/> have not intruſted it all in One hand, but have ſo equally divided it among the <hi>Magiſtrates, Senate,</hi> and <hi>Prerogative Tribe,</hi> that No publique Action can be performed without the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all; Now there is nothing more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable then that all theſe ſhould concur to the Oppreſſing the <hi>People,</hi> changing the <hi>Government,</hi> or diſturbing it with <hi>Sedition;</hi> Then which greater Security is not attainable in Matter of <hi>Government.</hi> But all this riſes no higher then the Caſe of mixt <hi>Government.</hi> For the Power being wholly paſt from the <hi>People,</hi> and divided equally among theſe ſeverall Perſons, This equality of Power muſt upon their Diſagreement reduce the Commonwealth to a Civill <hi>War,</hi> ſeeing it is not otherwaies to be judged which of them has the <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> and by that a Right to the Obedience of the Reſt. Now that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long Agree, is a Conſequence of that Deſire of Power which is confeſt to dwell with Man, and will not permit him to reſt ſatisfied with Part of that <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> which He may fairely hope to poſſeſs Intire. And if there are any Examples of Perſons thus Poſſeſt of equall Power, who have for a while maintained a good Correſpondence with one another, and ſo preſerved the Commonwealth in Peace, This muſt not be attributed to the Frame or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>Government,</hi> but to ſome externall Cauſe, ſuch as the Apprehenſion of ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Impending danger, Or an over high Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of one another's ſtrength, by which there is generated in them a mutuall Fear of one
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43887:54"/> another: As two Armies when neither of them has any Viſible Advantage of ſtrength, do very often forbeare engaging out of a mutuall doubt of the Succeſs, which notwithſtanding is not a ſtate of <hi>Peace,</hi> ſeeing both are intent upon the Opportunities of procuring one anothers Ruine.</p>
               <p>It having been thus Proved, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Oceana,</hi> which was given us as the Example of a moſt equall Commonwealth, is which way ſoever the Caſe be ſtated, liable not only to Sedition, but which is more, to a totall Diſſolution, It is at the ſame time evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>That a Commonwealth coming up to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the kind, comes not up to the Perfection of Government, but has a Flaw in it.</hi> I do not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that after this Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> will any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger think fit to accuſe Me of <hi>hudling things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 40.</note> or <hi>neglecting of Principles;</hi> It is true I can not admit of his <hi>Principles,</hi> becauſe, as I have often told him, They are meerly Effects &amp; Conſequences of <hi>Government,</hi> that is no <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> at all. And while He thus goes aſtray in the <hi>Principles,</hi> His Labour muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, both in examining the Models of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Commonwealth's, and in propoſing New Ones of his own; For at this Rate New Models of Government may be contrived with as much eaſe, as a French Tayler invents new Faſhions. It is the Foundation of <hi>Government</hi> upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable <hi>Principles,</hi> and the Diductions from them, which render Politiques a Compleat Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, without which the greateſt Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with particular Commonwealths can but at moſt make Men <hi>Empiricks</hi> in Policy.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether Monarchy coming up to the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kind, come ſhort of the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Government, and have ſome Flaw in it?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT can not be with Reaſon expected that I ſhould aſſert <hi>Monarchie</hi> to be ſo far Privileg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as not to have a Flaw in it; For having in the preceding Diſcourſe laid it down for a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, <hi>That Men will eternally miſtake the Point of Government, and think it their Intereſt to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Supream Power,</hi> I ſhould now contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict my ſelf by affirming that of <hi>Monarchicall Government</hi> in particular, which I before deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all <hi>Government</hi> in Generall. Yet does not Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> gaine any Advantage by this, For though I confeſs that <hi>Monarchie</hi> comes not up to the imaginary Perfection of <hi>Government</hi> which He dreams of, but is indeed neither in a <hi>Monarchie</hi> nor a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> nor yet in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I am not at all diffident of making Good, That a Supream Hereditary <hi>Monarchie</hi> attaines to a greater Degree of Perfection, and has fewer Flaws in it then a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> or any other kind of <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not think it needfull to repeat either the Principles or Concluſions of the laſt Chapter, Only it will be uſefull to examine ſomewhat more at large the Cauſes or Reaſons why Men are not content with the <hi>Government</hi> they live
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43887:55"/> under, but do by a continuall Indeavour to ſubvert the <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> diſturb it with <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> Of which in Generall three Reaſons may be aſſigned.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a Deſire of Immunity from Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in ſuch Perſons as have by their Crimes render'd themſelves obnoxious to the Lawes; For it being impoſſible as long as Men are ſubject to Paſſions, but that ſuch Faults will be committed as the <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> has thought fit to puniſh with Death or the loſs of Eſtate, The Perſons who have commited thoſe Faults will indubitably ſeek to avoid the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which can not be done but by raiſing a Party able to reſiſt the <hi>Sovereign Power.</hi> And as Criminall Perſons ſeek to avoid Puniſhment for Crimes already committed, So Perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly in Debt or Indigent, who being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of that Induſtrie which might procure them a Subſiſtence in a Regular Way, know not how to live but by Rapine and Invading other Men's Propriety deſire to diſturb the Government that they may find Security in thoſe Crimes which for the Future they reſolve to Commit.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is a Want of Judgment to diſcern the Miſeries which attend War; For when a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſo long injoyed Peace that the Memory of the wretched Effects of a Civill War is defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, They are very Frequently deafe to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of Wiſer Men, to the Hiſtories of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, and to the Example of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, And ſo out of meer Wantoneſs throw away their own Happineſs, by ſuffering themſelves to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43887:55"/> be ingaged in a War againſt the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> the Conſequences of which they had never taken the leaſt pains to Conſider. And to this they are very eaſily brought, whenſoever thoſe Men who are by ſome other Motive ingaged to ſeek the ſubverſion of the <hi>Government,</hi> have Credit enough with the People to impoſe a Cheat upon them, by making Uſe of the Names of Religion or Liberty, or ſome other like ſpecious Pretence.</p>
               <p>The third is that Deſire of Power which Men commonly underſtand by the Name of Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; This ſeems ſo twiſted with the being of Man that it is thought naturall to him, and no more ſeparable then his Affections or Paſſions. Yet if any Ambitious Man ſhould take himſelf to a ſtrict Account, and demand a Reaſon of his own Thoughts and Actions, If He ſhould contemplate Power with all the Dangers, Cares, and Inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes intayled upon it, And ſtrip it of that gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Dreſs with which the Deluded World has adorned it, He would find his Purſuit of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er extreamly Irrationall, unleſs ſo far as it did neceſſarily conduce to his own Preſervation. The Deſire of ſelf Preſervation was (as I ſaid formerly) the firſt ſtep to <hi>Government,</hi> and the Inſtitution of <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> was the Caution that every Man had of every other Man for his Preſervation; Yet this did not ſatisfy, becauſe it quickly appeared that though good Laws were ordained for every Man's Protection, yet they could not alwaies come in time enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent particular Miſchiefs, So that Men judged it Rationall, beſides the generall Protection they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43887:56"/> injoyed from the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> to arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a particular Power againſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Dangers. Nor did Men ſtop here, but out of their incurable Suſpition of all other Men, They became as much afraid of the <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> as they were before of one another, And ſo continually endeavoured to acquire ſuch Power as might even defend them from the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> which Deſign could never be thought fully attained by them untill the <hi>Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> it ſelf was in their Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>The Deſire then of ſuch a Power as may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Man, in ſuch Caſes where the Laws are not ſufficient to do it, from other private Men, implying a Submiſſion to the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting in a Method not prohibited by him, can never bring danger to <hi>Government.</hi> But the Deſire of a Power able to defend them from the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> is properly that Ambition which is the Fountaine from whence flow the chiefeſt Dangers that threaten <hi>Government,</hi> And is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies unjuſt though more or leſs condemnable according to the Temper of thoſe who injoy the <hi>Sovereign Power;</hi> For if They are juſt and Vertuous Perſons, and uſe not to make any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions on the Lives and Fortunes of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, this Ambition is the more Criminall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt Motive to it was falſe and Irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; But if they are known Oppreſſors of the People, and ſuch who conſider not that They injure themſelves by trampling upon the Lives and Fortunes of their Subjects, It is a little more excuſable, being an indeavour (though
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43887:56"/> by an unjuſt Method) of preſerving ſuch Things as deſerve not to be wilfully thrown away.</p>
               <p>I have ſtudiouſly abſtained from reckoning the Deſire of Riches among the Cauſes of <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> For if it be a Deſire of Moderate Riches ſuch as are ſubſervient to the Neceſſities or Conveniences of Man's Life, or to the attaining Innocent and Honeſt Pleaſures, They may with far greater eaſe and Probability be acquired by private and Legall Induſtrie then by diſturbing the <hi>Government;</hi> And it is in Experience that thoſe Men who are moſt taken up with this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, are of all People the leaſt turbulent, and do moſt abominate Commotions. But if it be a Deſire of exceſſive Riches, ſuch Riches can not be deſirable in themſelves but only as They are the Inſtruments of Power; And ſo this Deſire is to be reduced to the Deſire of Power.</p>
               <p>If Revenge, Love, or any other Paſſion has ſometimes given the firſt Impulſe to the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of <hi>Government,</hi> theſe Accidents are ſo Particular and Infrequent, that they can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to have Place in a Generall Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Having thus in generall diſcovered the firſt Cauſes of <hi>Sedition</hi> in all <hi>Government,</hi> the next Work muſt be to ſhow by what Art or Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the <hi>Sovereign</hi> may prevent the Miſchief, and ſuſpend the Effects in their Cauſes. And for obviating the firſt Cauſe of Sedition, many particular Cares are neceſſary; As the diligent Execution of Lawes, that ſo every Offence may be overtaken by the Puniſhment; then the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43887:57"/> of Manufactures and Traffique which fetching Wealth from abroad, cure the Subject of Want and Neceſſity at home; After that a Prohibition of Exceſs in ſuch things (as Gaming, Clothes, and the like) by which Men go in Chace of Poverty; And laſt of all, When notwithſtanding all theſe Cares, Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and Indigent Perſons grow Numerous, A ſeaſonable Dreyning of them away by a Foreign War or Plantations.</p>
               <p>The Prevention of the ſecond Cauſe of <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> conſiſts in having the People ſufficiently inſtructed in the Sad and Miſerable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a Civill War, in Compariſon of which the greateſt Preſſures under the worſt of <hi>Governments</hi> are no Evils. But it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that this is a Text upon which the Wiſe part of the World has uſed in vaine to Preach to the Fooles, And therefore there is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Fortune in it, which very much ſecures thoſe Princes who come in juſt upon the laſt Act of a Civill War; For there being no Man then alive in whom there is not a freſh Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Calamities of War, They have them in ſuch Deteſtation, as that They are willing to ſuffer any thing rather then be a ſecond time plunged into that miſerable Condition.</p>
               <p>Againſt the third Cauſe of <hi>Seditions,</hi> the Virtue and Innocence of the Prince is a Grand Remedy; for if his Subjects find Protection from him againſt all other Men, and have no juſt ground to ſuſpect any Prejudice from him in their Lives or Fortunes, It would be deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43887:57"/> unreaſonable to enter into any Diffidence of Him, or out of an Ambitious Deſire of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to ſeek to ſubvert the <hi>Government.</hi> Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Mankind are not Philoſophers, And a great part of thoſe over whom <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> is to be exerciſed, are not guided by Reaſon, but miſled by Paſſion and falſe Conſequences, It will be neceſſary to arm a <hi>Sovereign</hi> with ſomewhat more then his own Innocence, and give him a Power ſufficient to repreſs thoſe Brutiſh and Irrationall Subjects.</p>
               <p>Here then it will concern Us to inquire what are the Advantages of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> over his Subjects. It is manifeſt that theſe conſiſt not in the perſonall ſtrength of a <hi>Monarch,</hi> nor yet of a <hi>Sovereign Aſſembly;</hi> For the firſt is but the ſtrength of one Man, and the other but of a few Men, who beare no Proportion to thoſe who are to be governed by them: Therefore the Advantages of the <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> proceed from this, That their Subjects have given up their particular ſtrengths to be imployed at the Diſcretion of the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> So that in the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> the diffuſed ſtrength of a Multitude is united in One Perſon, which in a <hi>Monarchy</hi> is a Naturall Perſon, in a <hi>State</hi> an Artificiall One procreated by a majority of Votes. The Deſire in particular Men of retracting this Gift, or Reaſſuming the Power they had confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> (which proceeds from ſome of the Cauſes already mentioned but moſt particularly from the third) is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all <hi>Sedition;</hi> This at firſt can be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43887:58"/> of but One Man, who upon diſcovery of Symptomes of like Inclinations may impart it to ſome Few, and they afterward Communicate it to more, ſo as at length to be able to form a Party ſufficient to diſturb the <hi>Government</hi> with <hi>Sedition.</hi> So that in Effect, the Advantage of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> over his Mutinous Subjects, is the ſame that an United ſtrength has over a divided One, or an Army over a greater Multitude of diſperſed and Scattered People. In conſequence of which it may be inferred, That the Great Art of Governing (next to that of withdrawing the Cauſes and Matter of Sedition by the Virtue &amp; Innocence of the Sovereign's Actions) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in being verſt in thoſe Methods by which a Number of Diſcontented Perſons may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd from becoming a Party, that is framing ſuch a Correſpondence among themſelves as to be able to Act with one Common Conſent and Deſign.</p>
               <p>To diſcourſe of the Vigilance of the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> in obſerving all the Motions of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or of the Intelligence He ought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for diſcovering all their <hi>Cabals,</hi> belongs not to this Place; Theſe things are according to the different Complexions of Times and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires infinitely various, and depend every where upon the particular Sufficiency of the Miniſters. Only I may obſerve, That where there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of any conſiderable part of the People which depend not wholly upon the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,</hi> both as to the times of their Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Diſſolution, and as to the Matter and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43887:58"/> Manner of their Conſulations, ſuch <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> do eaſily become the Cradles of <hi>Sedition,</hi> and are therefore very Dangerous, and ſcarſe to be with Prudence permitted by the <hi>Sovereign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let Us therefore conſider a <hi>Sedition</hi> as ready to go alone, and juſt fitted to walk abroad and take the Aire. The firſt Steps of it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be infirm and ſtaggering, For They who firſt Diſcover themſelves are ſure to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately attaqued by the United Force of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,</hi> againſt which They can have little hope to prevaile; For their own Party being unſetled and Raw, And that of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> formed before hand the Oddes muſt needs be very Great; And therefore the Broachers of <hi>Seditions,</hi> are generally Men altogether Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, who deſpiſe the Certitude of thoſe Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers by which all Conſidering Men are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. This then is the Grand Security of all <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns,</hi> whether ſingle Perſons or Aſſemblies, That the united Force of their Subjects with which They are inveſted, is ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Beginnings of all <hi>Seditions,</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this No <hi>Government</hi> has any Amulets that can preſerve it; For if ſome <hi>Seditions</hi> have been ſuppreſſed after they were broke out into actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Civill Wars, That has not been by any Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the <hi>Government,</hi> but is to be attributed to the ſame Cauſes that ſerve to determine the Succeſſes of Wars between diſtinct <hi>Sovereign Powers.</hi> And therefore No <hi>Sovereign</hi> ought to expect his ſafety from any Frame or Temper of the <hi>Government,</hi> or from the ſettled orders
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43887:59"/> of the Commonwealth, but from his own Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in withdrawing the Matter, his Prudence and Dexterity in preventing the Contrivance, And his Celerity and Reſolution in ſuppreſſing the Beginnings of <hi>Seditions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then remaines is only to take a View of the particular Method which a <hi>Monarch</hi> is capacitated to obſerve, in order to his Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, And to Compare it with the Methods of other <hi>Governments.</hi> Seeing the firſt Compact of every Man to part with his private Power, upon which <hi>Sovereignty</hi> was founded, is by experience found too weak to ſupport the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> All <hi>Monarchs</hi> have found it neceſſary to communicate ſome Part of this Power with which themſelves are veſted, to ſome ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Miniſters who by this have a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Intereſt in the ſafety of the <hi>Monarch</hi> then the reſt of his Subjects, and therefore are more likely in any Danger to ſtand by him: This Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er according to the ſeverall Intentions of the <hi>Monarch,</hi> either upon the Death of the Perſon to whom it was committed reverts again to the <hi>Monarch,</hi> or is tranſmitted to his next Heire, as one from whom the <hi>Monarch</hi> has reaſon to expect the ſame Services; This laſt Caſe is the Generation of a <hi>Nobility,</hi> who uſe to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh't from other Men by ſuch Titles with which the <hi>Monarch</hi> has thought fit to adorn them. And becauſe Riches (whether in Land or other Revenue) are a principall Fountain of all ſuch Power as is ſubordinate to the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power,</hi> either the <hi>Nobility</hi> uſes to have
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43887:59"/> conſiderable Riches conferred upon them by the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> or elſe ſuch Perſons as by their own Induſtrie have attained conſiderable Riches are advanced to be of the <hi>Nobility.</hi> Thus has a <hi>Monarch</hi> attained the firſt Degree of his Security, That there are a conſiderable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Perſons who being intruſted with ſome Portion of Power by him, have by that both an Ability and Intereſt to defend him againſt all ſuch as go about to diſturb the <hi>Government</hi> with <hi>Sedition;</hi> For ſome of theſe Perſons being preſent in all Quarters of the Dominion, and injoying by the <hi>Monarch's</hi> Authority an united Power, can not be ſuppoſed to faile in ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Weake and Disjoynted beginnings of all <hi>Seditions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It has been and ſtill is a Queſtion, Whether it be moſt advantagious for a <hi>Monarch</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate this Power only by Commiſſion to ſuch Perſons as He finds moſt capable of doing him Service, and that without any Promiſſory Obligation upon himſelf either to continue it to their Poſterity, or to themſelves longer theu his Good Pleaſure, Or whether it be beſt for Him to tranſmit it to their Poſterity, and by that to conſtitute a <hi>Nobility.</hi> But I think it will not be hard to determine the Queſtion in favour of a <hi>Nobility</hi> out of theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there is more Safety in a <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> then in the other way of temporary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, againſt a Forreign Enemy; Seeing it is the Intereſt of the whole <hi>Nobility</hi> to defend
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43887:60"/> to the utmoſt Extremity that <hi>Monarch,</hi> from whom They and their Poſterity injoy a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhare of Power then They have Reaſon to expect from a Conquerour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That even againſt his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Security a <hi>Monarch</hi> gains by a <hi>Nobility</hi> is greater then He can have the other Way; For there being a radicated Power in a <hi>Nobility,</hi> the Impreſſions of Awe and Reverence upon the <hi>People</hi> are greater from them, then they can be from any temporary Commander.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It being ſo naturall to all Men to deſire the Welfare of their Poſterity, a <hi>Nobility</hi> has greater Intereſts to preſerve the <hi>Monarch</hi> by whoſe Favour both They and their Children are poſſeſt of a confiderable Power, then They can have who wanting a Promiſe from the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norch</hi> for the Continuation of this Power, may juſtly look upon themſelves as Tenants at Will, And ſo may have a Concernment to endeavour by ſome Innovation in the <hi>Government,</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcertain this Power to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Yet this is not to be taken Abſolutely and without Reſtriction; For ſeeing a <hi>Nobility,</hi> is ſubject to the ſame Paſſions with other Men, a <hi>Monarch</hi> is not to make Account that the Greatneſs of the Benefits They injoy by Him, ſhould be enough to keep his <hi>Nobility</hi> within the Bounds of Duty: Nay farther, That Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition which We have Defined to be a Deſire of Power ſufficient to defend one from the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power,</hi> is chiefly incident to the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> becauſe They poſſeſſing Much, are moſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43887:60"/> apt to think themſelves a Prey conſiderable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to tempt the <hi>Sovereign's</hi> Avarice. And therefore as a <hi>Nobility</hi> is a <hi>Monarchs</hi> Guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>People,</hi> ſo a <hi>Monarch</hi> may ſtand in need of another Guard againſt the <hi>Nobility,</hi> to ſecure him againſt ſuch Dangers as otherwiſe He might incur from their Ambition.</p>
               <p>Theſe Dangers are of two kinds; For either They proceed from ſome particular Perſons of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> excelling the reſt of their Order in Power or Dignity, Or they ariſe from the whole Body of the <hi>Nobility.</hi> If a <hi>Monarch</hi> has out of the Conſideration of neerneſs of Blood, or his own Affections, or Greatneſs of Merit, conferred a large ſhare of Power upon one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Familie, with leave to tranſmit it to their Poſterity, this Power may eaſily become Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Danger, if not to Him, at leaſt to his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. Thus the Succeſſors of <hi>Charles the Great</hi> in <hi>Germanie,</hi> and this <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> by conferring upon ſome of the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> an Hereditary Power over Provinces large enough to raiſe and maintain an Army, broke thoſe two great <hi>Monarchies</hi> into a Multitude of little Ones, though the latter of them has had the Fortune to recover, and be again conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated into one great Empire. At firſt, no doubt, there were ſome ſuch Duties reſerved by the ſupream <hi>Monarch</hi> as ſerved to manifeſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of theſe leſſer Ones upon him, But they eaſily degenerating into Matters of meere Forme and Ceremony, and the <hi>People</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eyes to look beyond the next Object; Theſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43887:61"/> Dependant <hi>Monarchs</hi> were by their Subjects ſoone conſidered as Abſolute Ones, and thought to ſhine by their own Native Light though it were at firſt derived to them from the great Luminary of the <hi>Sovereign Power.</hi> Where the Error of former <hi>Monarchs</hi> has thus deformed the Naturall ſhape of Empire, and rendered Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment a Monſter with more Heads then One, It is it vaine for the Prince to expect Security, or for the Subjects to hope for Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity: For if the exorbitant Power of theſe Great On<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s among the <hi>Nobility</hi> can not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench't, the State can have no Aſſurance of Safety but that caſuall One which is obtained from the Content and Satisfaction of theſe Great Perſons; And that is not like to continue longer then they are taken up with ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Imployment abroad, they being in this like tame Lions, whoſe Keepers are no longer out of Danger of being torne in Pieces, then they maintain them full gorged.</p>
               <p>The Dangers that ariſe from the whole Body of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> are when the Nobility is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of a Right to Aſſemble themſelves for the Electing a Succeſſour to the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or for making of War and Peace, or for nominating the great Miniſters of State, or for performing any other Act which by the Nature of it is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the <hi>Sovereign Power.</hi> This Happens either when the <hi>Monarch</hi> did at firſt, out of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs of Reigning, accept of the Kingdome with a leſs ſhare of Power then was neceſſary for attaining the Ends of <hi>Government,</hi> or has
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43887:61"/> ſince parted with this power out of an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous beliefe, That <hi>Sovereignty</hi> could ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without it. And if in theſe Caſes the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has been <hi>Seditious,</hi> this can be no Argument againſt a <hi>Soverign Monarch,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Caſes ſuppoſe the Prince to want that power which was requifite to make him <hi>Sovereign.</hi> Though even in theſe Caſes, there want not examples of ſome able Princes who by their Artifice in Ballancing the ſeverall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> have for a long time preſerved themſelves and People in ſafety.</p>
               <p>Where neither ſome few perſons of the <hi>Nobility</hi> are poſſeſt of exceſſive power and Command, nor where the whole body of the <hi>Nobility</hi> has a Right to aſſemble for the ends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, It is not imaginable how a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> ſhould be dangerous to a <hi>Monarch;</hi> For though the <hi>Nobility</hi> are not ſo great a multitude as the <hi>People,</hi> yet they are a multitude, and by Conſequence expoſed, in proportion to the ſame Difficulties and Dangers in carrying on a Deſigne for diſturbing the <hi>Government;</hi> &amp; the ſame remedies are applicable againſt them, which were by them made uſe of againſt the <hi>People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Remedies are in generall two; Firſt that the <hi>Monarch</hi> have continually in pay a ſufficient <hi>Militia</hi> to be alwaies ready to march for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the firſt motions or tendency toward a <hi>Sedition;</hi> Secondly that ſeing every Country has ſome places of ſtrength where a few may be ſecure againſt a great number, theſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be kept at the Monarch's Devotion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43887:62"/> by a convenient proportion of Souldiers, for in this caſe the <hi>Nobility</hi> wanting places of Defence to ſecure themſelves at the beginning of their Attempt, And knowing aſſuredly that they ſhall be expoſed to the danger of being cut in pieces by the <hi>Militia</hi> entertained by the <hi>Monarch,</hi> They cannot be ſuppoſed ſo Irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall as out of vain and uncertain Hopes of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power to incur the forfeit of that of which they are already poſſeſt.</p>
               <p>To aſſign the number of this Souldiery can never be done, not only becauſe Different <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies</hi> ſtand in need of Different Proportions, but the ſame <hi>Monarchy</hi> may require Different proportions at different times; Only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, it may paſs for a neceſſary Maxime, That this <hi>Militia</hi> ought not to amount to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat full Army; For beſides that the Expence would devonr any <hi>Monarch,</hi> The experience of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperours and all other <hi>Princes</hi> who have kept great Armies as a guard to their Perſons and Empire, teach us that this is to walke upon precipices, There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no poſſibility of preventing ſuch an Army (eſpecially if they lye ſtill without Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) from acquiring an Intereſt diſtinct from that of the Prince. Therefore this <hi>Militia</hi> muſt be ſo inſtituted as that it can have no Intereſt beſides the Pay it receives from the <hi>Monarch,</hi> nor any hopes of being ſafe in their own ſtrength if they ſhould withdraw themſelves from the Service and Obedience due to him.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:43887:62"/>
               <p>This is that mixture of a <hi>Monarchy</hi> by a <hi>Nobility,</hi> and a <hi>Monarchy</hi> by <hi>Armes</hi> in which conſiſts the perfection of <hi>Monarchicall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Nor do I enter into deſpaire of living to enjoy my ſhare of the Felicities which will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Subjects of ſuch a <hi>Government,</hi> though <hi>Mr Harrington</hi> be poſitive in aſſerting, <hi>That the wit of man never found, nor ſhall find this</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. pag. 72.</note> 
                  <hi>Monarchy, there being no ſuch thing in Nature.</hi> And his Reaſon for this moſt Tyrannous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, is only this <hi>That there is nothing in</hi>

                  <hi>Nature that hath not had a naturall effect by ſome example.</hi> I believe <hi>Mr Harrington</hi> would not think himſelf ſincerely dealt with, if he ſhould be told, There is no ſuch thing in nature as an equall Commonwealth, becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Nature that hath not had a Naturall Effect by ſome Example; But the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Oceana</hi> is (by his own Confeſſion) <note place="margin">Ocena. p. 23.</note>

                  <note place="margin">ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Government which if it have been ſeditious, it hath not been from any Imperfection in the kind, but</hi> for want of this mixture <hi>in the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; which where ever the like hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened muſt have</hi> wanted this mixture.</p>
               <p>He is willing to ſuppoſe that I underſtand <note place="margin">H. pag. 70.</note> 
                  <hi>France</hi> as an inſtance of this mixture; But that <hi>France</hi> cannot be an Inſtance of it is manifeſt by this, That the Princes of the Blood do there
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43887:63"/> poſſeſs ſuch an exceſſive power, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared inconſiſtent with this mixture, a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which power have been all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſeditions of <hi>France</hi> in this laſt age. In many other things I allow that <hi>France</hi> is not far remote from this mixture, much of which alſo may be diſcovered in the <hi>Caſtilian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> in the adminiſtration of the Duke of <hi>Florence's Government,</hi> and the <hi>Pope's</hi> Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Domiuion in <hi>Italy.</hi> But it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, That to make good the poſſibility of this mixture, I am not obliged to produce the Example of a <hi>Monarchy</hi> that has continued free from <hi>Seditions,</hi> ſince I have endeavoured to prove that it is impoſſible any <hi>Government</hi> ſhould be altogether free from them: It is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly enough if the Reigns of able <hi>Monarch;</hi> have not been troubled with <hi>Seditions,</hi> or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ſuch as have been immediately ſuppreſt, For the art of apprehending and preſerving this mixture is not attainable by any univerſall Rules or Frame of Policy, but is a perſonall Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Capacity and Experience of every <hi>Monarch:</hi> And therefore to expect that a weak Prince can long continue to Govern ſecurely by the maximes and Conſtitutions of a wiſe predeceſſor, is all one as to imagine that the Tools of ſome excellent Artificer falling into the Hands of an ignorant perſon ſhould ſerve to make good worke.</p>
               <p>And this ſeems to be the only conſiderable objection againſt us, That this mixture cannot <note place="margin">H. p. 72.</note> be durable, becauſe <hi>the Nobility in this caſe would</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:43887:63"/> 
                  <hi>not keep down the People, but fetch them up (as did the Barons) into their ſcale, that together they might weigh down the Army; which is the infallible Conſequence of this mixture.</hi> Where the <hi>Nobility</hi> has already got too great Head, and where the Prince by the unſeaſonable applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Army goes about to reduce them, I deny not but this may perhaps be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; But then this Caſe ſuppoſes the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> poſſeſt of a power from which They will be excluded by this mixture; And as this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture takes from them the power ſo does it the Intereſt alſo, it being impoſſible for the Nobility to League with the People, or <hi>fetch them up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſcale,</hi> without looſing ſome part of that power which by the <hi>Monarch</hi> they injoyed over the <hi>People.</hi> This Caſe of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>People</hi> uniting againſt the Monarch can never happen unleſs the Monarch is at once become through his own Vices and Cruelty univerſally odious, and through his Imprudence and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution univerſally contemptible; And I doe with much readineſſe confeſſe, That ſuch <hi>Princes</hi> are not to look for ſecurity, it being not in the Deſign of God or Nature, or in the power of Art to make thoſe men Happy who will not cooperate toward the attaining their own Happineſs.</p>
               <p>This Temper of a Monarchy is the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water Marke beyond which no Government can riſe; That all other Government muſt needs fall a great deale ſhort of it I am in the laſt place to make Evident. And that a <hi>popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:43887:64"/> or <hi>Commonwealth</hi> muſt doe ſo is apparent by the laſt Chapter, where it has been proved That this kind of <hi>Government</hi> is neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed not only to <hi>Sedition</hi> but totall Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For a <hi>Government</hi> by a <hi>Sovereign Aſſembly</hi> or <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> As it is expoſed to all the ſame Originall Cauſes of <hi>Sedition</hi> with a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, ſo it wants the Remedies which conſiſt in Secrecie and Celerity, that are the peculiar Advantages of a ſingle perſon's Adminiſtration: Beſides, this Inconvenience belongs particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to a <hi>Sovereign Aſſembly,</hi> that one or more perſons of it carrying on a ſecret Deſign to change the Government may have Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit enough in the Aſſembly to corrupt their Conſultations, and ſo make the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> an Inſtrument to their own ſubverſion. Laſtly for a <hi>Monarchy</hi> either by <hi>Armes</hi> or a <hi>Nobility</hi> taken ſingly, This Mixture of both curing the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of each muſt neceſſarily have the Advantage of them.</p>
               <p>If Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> be of Opinion that I ought to have laid down a particular Modell of this kind of <hi>Government,</hi> I muſt in this alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Difference of my Judgement from his; For though a Generall Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Government</hi> may fairly become any Gentleman, the propoſing (or impoſing rather) a particular Modell ſeems to reliſh too much of a Deſign, and wants that Modeſtie and ſubmiſſion that ought to be in all Private Men.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether a Commonwealth that was not firſt broken by her ſelfe, were ever conquered by the Armes of any Monarch.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN this Chapter Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> is forced to be of the Conſiderer's mind, though to keep up his Credit, He ſeems to be upon high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions with Him. For He tells Us that <hi>He is not to be argued againſt out of the little Cities in Aſia, which having no conſiderable Army, if</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. pag. 75.</note> 
                  <hi>they ſhould be ſubdued by ſome potent Monarch, concerns the Government no more then if they had been overwhelmed by ſome Inundation or ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by ſome Earthquake.</hi> This is perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Conſiderers ſence, who has declared that He thinks the Inference Fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous which is made from the ſucceſſe of <hi>Arms</hi> to the perfection of <hi>Government.</hi> But it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> to have thought of this ſooner, it being now too late to Retreat with Honor, or to clog that Propoſition with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions which had before been ſo poſitively and univerſally laid down by him, <hi>That a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth was never conquered by any Monarch from the beginning of the world unto this Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet that the Conſiderer may have no Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be proud, Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> lets Him ſee how he lies at Mercy, and how his project of a Monarchy (whenſoever it ſhall be thought
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43887:65"/> fit to uſe ſo killing an Argument) may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally <note place="margin">H. p. 74.</note> ruined by the Example of the <hi>King of Yvetot:</hi> I acknowledg the great importance of that Argument, and am willing to come to termes with him about it; And ſo long as he will conſent to ſuppreſs this Example of <hi>Yvetot</hi> in exchange of the kindneſs I promiſe him not to draw any Argument for the Advantage of Monarchy, from the Antient and Illuſtrious Reign of King <hi>Oberon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Conſiderer muſt not ſeem to be left in the poſſeſſion of any truth, And therefore the firſt generall Anſwer will not ſerve Mr <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringtons</hi> turn, but he goes on to deny that there is any truth in the inſtances which I brought to prove that <hi>Commonwealths</hi> have been conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Monarchs.</hi> The firſt of thoſe was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the <hi>Commonwealths</hi> of the <hi>Grecians</hi> planted on the Coaſts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> concerning which I am chalenged to ſhew that they <note place="margin">H. p. 75.</note> came under the power of the <hi>Lydian</hi> and <hi>Perſian Monarchs</hi> by Conqueſt, or otherwiſe then by the purchaſe of <hi>Croeſus</hi> his mony. I am aſhamed that Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> ſhould thus go on to oblige me; He has taught a new way by Me neer thought on, for the diſſolution of a <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> Let a People be united into a Republique, Let their City be fortifyed with Walls, let them have Armes in their Hands, Nay let the Ballance be fixt by an <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law; To what purpoſe ſerves all this? There comes one with a little ready Mony in his purſe, and He for twenty yeares

This is ſo pretty, that I am ſorry I can not leave it thus, but am obliged to examine what <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> has ſaid in Reference to the way by which <hi>Croeſus</hi> obtained the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Cities. <hi>This Croeſus was the firſt Barbarian We know</hi>

                  <hi>meanes were kept back from growing great, ſo alſo the Jonians by this, That the Perſian Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires proſpering, Cyrus and the Perſian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, after the Defeat of Croeſus, made War upon all that lieth from the River Halys to the Sea ſide, and ſo ſubdued all the Cities which they poſſeſſed in the Continent; And Darius afterward, when he had overcome the Phoeniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Fleet did the like to them in the Iſlands.</hi> Both which Teſtimonies are ſummed up by <hi>Strabo,</hi> where He tels Us, <hi>That the Perſians were the firſt who obtained Dominion over the</hi>

                  <hi>Graecians, For though the Lydians had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43887:66"/> of them, it was not through all Aſia, but only of a ſmall part of it which lies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the River Halys, and that only for a ſmall time during the Reigns of Craeſus and Alyattes. But they being overcome by the Perſians, loſt to them whatſoever Glorie they had gained. For the Perſians as ſoon as they had ſubdued the Medes, preſently made themſelves Maſters of the Lydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and brought into Subjection the Graecians in Aſia.</hi> Upon the Defeat of <hi>Croeſus</hi> the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Republiques had, it ſeems, recovered their Liberty ſo far, as to be in a Condition to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which is clearly implyed by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> when having related the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of that War, He ſaies <hi>It was the ſecond time thoſe Graecians were brought into Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi> And though during the proſperous For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the <hi>Europaean Graecians</hi> many Attempts were made to free the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Ones from that Yoake, They were finally neceſſitated to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, being by an expreſs Article of the <note place="margin">Xenoph.

With Permiſſion then I ſay it, This <hi>Example does more then preſume.</hi> It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes as firmly as can be done by Hiſtoricall Proofs; And what Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> has ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently <note place="margin">H. pag. 74.</note> aſſumed, <hi>That theſe Cities can not be ſhewn to have had the Command of any Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Army</hi> will not ſerve to enervate it. Of the <hi>Jonians</hi> were eleven or twelve Cities, of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43887:66"/> the <hi>Aeolians</hi> as many, of the <hi>Dorians</hi> five, with their Territories, all united by Leagues and Confederacies; Now by granting that theſe had no conſiderable Army (which lies under a great Suſpition of Falſehood, for they had one good enough to venture the hazard of a Battle with <hi>Harpagus</hi> one of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals) He grants the Vanity of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, That military Virtue ſhould be the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Effect of <hi>Popular Government,</hi> Or that <hi>Commonwealths</hi> have meerly by Virtue of their Policy been preſerved from being conquered by <hi>Monarchs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Example of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Republiques which I next made uſe of, Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> ſaies <note place="margin">H. pag. 75.</note> 
                  <hi>there is not ſo much as a Preſumption in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;</hi> But either his skill or his Fidelity in point of Hiſtorie is ſo ſlender, that We can not rely upon his Word. The Condition of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> in the Age We diſpute about was not unlike that of <hi>Greece,</hi> the Seacoaſts being planted with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Populous and Opulent Cities, which injoying their Liberty, made ſo many diſtinct Commonwealths ſubſiſting by themſelves, and joyned only by Leagues not durable, but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient and changing according to the Exigence of Affaires. The chief and moſt conſiderable of theſe was <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> which knew ſo ill how to conſerve her Liberty, that for the greateſt Part ſhe lived under the Power of Abſolute Princes, Whom the <hi>Popular Graecians,</hi> then the only Maſters of Appellations, taught the World to call <hi>Tyrants,</hi> though ſome of them
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43887:67"/> are known to have been Princes of excellent Virtue and Goodneſs. That theſe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> themſelves, and ſo can not be accounted to have come to their Power by Conqueſt I have no need to deny, For Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> erres very much if He thinks theſe are the Examples I at firſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; I ſhall only inſiſt upon ſuch Acquiſitions as have been made by theſe abſolute Princes of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> over the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Republiques, in reſpect of whom their Arms were Forreign, and their Succeſſes pure Conqueſts. It being only a piece of Oſtentation to heape together a multitude of Examples, I will neglect ſuch as the Reigns of <hi>Gelon</hi> and the firſt <hi>Hiero</hi> do furniſh, and fix only upon thoſe of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Elder. This Prince, 'tis true, did from meane beginnings clime up to a great Fortune, and at length juggled himſelf into the Throne; But yet his Government was ſignaliſed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Actions, againſt the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> eſpecially who had newly begun to ſettle in <hi>Sicilie:</hi> But that in which We are concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is the Advantage he obtained over ſome <note place="margin">Diod. Sic. lib. 14.</note> of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Commonwealths, three of which, <hi>Naxus, Catana,</hi> and the <hi>Leontines,</hi> He reduced in one Expedition, deſtroyed their Cities, and tranſplanted the People into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Places. A while after the <hi>Tauromeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> abandoned by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> did not run a much gentler Fortune. From thence let Us follow him into the Southern part of <hi>Italie,</hi> (which, though in the ſtile of a later
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43887:67"/> Age, is <hi>Sicilie</hi> too) and there We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him Defeating in a very great Battle, the <hi>Crotoniates</hi> with the Confoederate Forces of all the <hi>Graecian</hi> Republiques in <hi>Italie,</hi> the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of one of which called <hi>Caulonia,</hi> was the firſt conſequence of his Victorie. The yeare after, <hi>Rhegium</hi> a Commonwealth ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as to have a Fleet of threeſcore and ten Gallies at Sea, was after an obſtinate Siege of eleven Months forced to ſurrender to Him, and thoſe Inhabitants which ſurvived the War and Famine, were put to their Ranſome, or ſold for Slaves. Theſe are the Inſtances by which the <hi>Sicilian Commonwealths</hi> are truly aſſerted to have been conquered by the Arms of a <hi>Monarch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe many other Examples out of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Hiſtorie might eaſily be added, but that Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> is not in a Diſpoſition to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by them. The ſeverall Republiques con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd by <hi>Darius</hi> might be enumerated, The Cities of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia</hi> that were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by <hi>Euagoras</hi> might be inquired into, The Commonwealths in <hi>Aſia</hi> (One of which that of the <hi>Sambeſtans</hi> brought an Army of ſixty thouſand Foot and ſix thouſand Horſe into the Field) that ſtoop't to <hi>Alexander's</hi> Victorious Sword might be inſiſted on; But they ſhall be all let paſs, ſince it is not the Number but Evidence of Arguments by which Truth is eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>The two Modern Examples of <hi>Genova</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> remain; Concerning the firſt of which Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Confeſſion that She was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued ſaves Me the Pains of proving the Matter
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43887:68"/> of Fact: What He has to object is but this, <note place="margin">H. pag. 76. and 77.</note> Firſt <hi>That though ſhe has been under, being yet ſtanding ſhe can not be ſaid to be conquered, but remaineth as ſhe was before Doria was born:</hi> And then <hi>That there is nothing plainer then that this Commonwealth was ſubdued by her own Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But if a Commonwealth has been ſubdued by a Forreign Prince, has by her Magiſtrates ſworn Fealty to Him, has received a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Garriſon, and has lived under this Power many yeares, (all which things concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the caſe of <hi>Genova)</hi> Shall ſhe ſtill be ſaid not to have been conquered, Becauſe by the Aſſiſtance and Protection of another Forreign Prince ſhe afterward happened to recover her Liberty? We may as well maintain that becauſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were reſtored to their Country and law by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> They can not be ſaid to have been conquer'd by the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians.</hi> Nor does <hi>Genoa remain as ſhe did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Doria was born,</hi> as will be apparent to him that will take the Pains to examine the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of thoſe times and Actions: Of doing which there is the more need becauſe Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> (I will not give him one of his own Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">H. pag. 6.</note> and ſay <hi>he does it, as is uſuall with him, falſely and fraudulently)</hi> has confounded the Diſtinct and different Conditions of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique before and after the Reſtauration of it by <hi>Doria.</hi> To the next Point, <hi>That this Commonwealth was ſubdued by her own Sedition,</hi> I have no more to ſay, but That this Reply is fitted for all Arguments, and would ſerve for
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43887:68"/> a Million of Inſtances (if ſo many could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced) as well as for this, there being no van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh't State which has not in ſome Meaſure cooperated to it's own Ruine.

               <p>After ſo liberall a taſt of Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in reference to theſe examples both Ancient and Modern, I am never to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded He meanes Good Faith when he calls for <hi>Reaſon and Experience</hi> to decide the Queſtion <note place="margin">H. p7. 77</note> about the Fate of Empires. In Humane Actions the Dependance of Effects upon their Cauſes is ſo obſcure, That the wiſeſt Hiſtorians doe but make conjectures when they indeavour to penetrate into them; Nor can any Diſcourſe of that Nature be ſo convincing from which ſo great a Maſter of Cavils as Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> may not find an Evaſion. Yet if I were to convince any Rationall unintereſted Perſon, That the Fate of Empires has not born a proportion to the Perfection of their <hi>Government,</hi> I need one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put him in mind that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> and <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> did for perfection of Government very far excell the rude <hi>Tartarians,</hi> by whom they have
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43887:71"/> been more then once conquered; That the <hi>Greek Emperours</hi> had a better Policy then the wild <hi>Arabians,</hi> to whom they loſt ſo great a part of their Dominions; That the very <hi>Roman</hi> Empire can not be thought to have been at ſuch a decay of Policy and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but that it was ſtill at a better paſſe then the Barbarous Nations by whom it was rent in pieces; For by that time it was pretty well cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of its worſt Maladie, the Inſolence of the Souldiers, who were grown leſs dangerous after the Empire came to be in a manner Hereditary.</p>

               <p>What he obſerves out of Sr <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> about the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> comes to little more then this, that the one affecting to fight on horſeback and the other on foot, the <hi>French</hi> have had a good Cavalry, and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a good Infantry; Though that too be now almoſt out of Date, for at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fight well enough on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back and in <hi>French</hi> on foot. The ſucceſſes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>France</hi> were never durable enough to have any thing of this Nature inferred from them; And we may obſerve they always followed the Perſon of the Prince: With us <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth wiſe &amp; valiant Princes gaining, <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt weak Princes looſing; With them <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt Men of no Ability looſing, <hi>Charles</hi> the fift and <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh Brave Princes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering.

               <p>In one point Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> has dealt very <note place="margin">H. p. 97.</note> diſcretly, when putting off the Robe of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator,</hi> He takes to him the Mantle of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> and with as little remorſe as an Almanack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker when he plays the interpreter to a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mete, predicts what ſhall befall <hi>Europe:</hi> For this not belonging to the preſent Age, will not be to be confuted bu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by our Great-Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children. Yet I am not aware of any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he can have to enter into ſo Tragicall an Humour for if he be offended that the Wars of <hi>Europe</hi> are of no more Diſpatch, <hi>Paruta's</hi> Diſcourſes would have furniſht him with ſeverall Reaſons for it, of which this is one, That <hi>Europe</hi> being parcelled out into ſeverall States, all Armed and watchfull over their own and their Neighbour's Intereſt, the grouth of any one State is preſently ballanced by a League of ſome of the other; At which worke the Miniſters of ſtate are every where become ſo expert, that to keep <hi>Europe</hi> equally poiſed, is little more with them then to trim a <hi>London</hi> Wherry. If I were diſpoſed to take my turne of Prediction, I might let Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> know that when by the Acceſſion of ſome Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or any great unthought of Revolution, the Houſes of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Auſtria</hi> ceaſe to be a drawn Match, then will he ſee thoſe great changes in <hi>Europe,</hi> which before it will be but in vain to expect. In the meane while he ought not to impute this to any Defect of Policy either in <hi>Germanie</hi> or <hi>Europe,</hi> more then of old in <hi>Greece,</hi> when being Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43887:72"/> into a multitude of Republiques ſhe did from the <hi>Peloponeſiac</hi> War to the Reign of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> fight ſo long time to ſo little Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Raguſa</hi> and <hi>San Marino,</hi> Mr <hi>Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> takes them by the wrong handle; They were not by Me made uſe of to ſhew that a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> has been conquer'd by the Arms of a <hi>Monarch,</hi> but only to prove that the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Arms</hi> has no neceſſary Dependance upon Perfection of <hi>Government,</hi> Seeing theſe <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths</hi> have a good <hi>Government,</hi> yet never were ſucceſſefull in Arms. Which part of the Argument is by Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> left untouch't and in full Force.</p>
               <p>There has been enough ſaid to evince the Falſehood of Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> firſt Aſſertion, <hi>That a Commonwealth was never Conquer'd by any Monarch from the beginning of the World to this Day;</hi> In diſcuſſing which, Occaſion has been alſo given to manifeſt the Vanity of another of his Conceptions, That the Succeſs of <hi>Arms</hi> depends upon the Perfection of the <hi>Government</hi> or Policy. His ſecond Aſſertion was, <hi>That a Commonwealth was the Government, which hath frequently led mighty Monarchs in Triumph.</hi> This the Conſiderer replied was to run upon the Foile, it being only the Converſion of the Firſt: Upon this Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> Triumphs too as well as his Commonwealth, and would have it thought that the Conſiderer took this for a Logicall Converſion of the Terms. But where <note place="margin">H. pag. 80.</note> did the Conſiderer reveale this to Him? If
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43887:73"/> Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> had not been at ſuch Enmity with <hi>Mathematiques</hi> and <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> He might have learn't there is a Converſion of Proportion, or of the Conſequence of things; And that this is not ſuch an one He will never be able to ſhew till he has made new Lawes of Ratiocination as well as of Government.</p>
               <p>If any Man ſhould chance to wonder how Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> laſt Paragraph comes to belong to this Chapter, He is to be advertiſed that the Coherence is both Elegant and Naturall, And conſiſts in this, <hi>Burning the fingers,</hi> and <hi>Bliſtring the tongue,</hi> Bliſtring, You know, uſes to follow Burning. This Bliſter forſooth, is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the Conſiderers tongue for having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> to this Aſſertion, <hi>That the Senate of Venice at the firſt inſtitution took in the whole People,</hi> Whereas he affirmed it not of the <hi>Senate but Commonwealth of Venice.</hi> But in doing this I wronged my ſelfe more then Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> it being neither my intention nor concernment to diſprove that Aſſertion to be true of the Senate, but of the <hi>Grand Counſell</hi> in which conſiſts the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> Now that tha <hi>Grand Counſell or Commonwealth did not,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 81.</note> 
                  <hi>even at the firſt inſtitution, take in the whole People of Venice,</hi> will appeare to be more then <hi>Perhaps. Gianotti</hi> does by very many and thoſe concluding Arguments make it out, That the firſt Inſtitution of the <hi>Grand Counſell</hi> was in the Reign of <hi>Sebaſtian Ciani,</hi> which began Anno 1175, And the bringing of it to Perfection in <hi>Gradenigo's</hi> time who entred upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43887:73"/> Anno 1297. This <hi>Councell</hi> never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of more then 4500 Perſons, And that theſe ſhould be the whole <hi>People</hi> is repugnant to all Hiſtories of the Increaſe and Power of the Commonwealth at that time. <hi>Giannotti</hi> alſo ſaies plainly, That it took in only ſuch of the People as were conſiderable for Eſtate and Quality. Nor is it materiall that <hi>Machiavel</hi> whom Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> followes is of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, for his Diſcourſe carries its own Refutation along with it, in as much as He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the <hi>Grand Counſell</hi> or diſtinction of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> and <hi>People</hi> to have been made at the very <note place="margin">Mach. Diſc. lib. 1. cap. 6.</note> Inſtitution of the Commonwealth, whereas <hi>Giannotti</hi> has proved it to be of a later Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall by many hundred yeares. A great part of the <hi>People</hi> being then excluded from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which in reſpect of them was une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, The inquiry was how theſe were kept in Obedience, of which an account was given out of <hi>Contarini.</hi> This account Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accuſe of any thing but an improper ſpeech (for the intention plainly looks another way) whilſt I attributed that to the <hi>Senate</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the whole <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> For which alſo He ſaves Me the paines of making any Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, ſince He confeſſes it to be a way of Locu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made uſe of by very good Authors.</p>

                  <p>Whether there be an Agrarian, or ſome Law, or Lawes of that Nature to ſupply the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it in every Commonwealth: And whether the Agrarian as it is ſtated in Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana, be equall and ſatisfactory to all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEcauſe it concerned Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> to ſhew his utmoſt Activity in this Chapter, That the Reader might take the leſs notice of the Slights and Tricks that were to be put upon him, he firſt of all confounds the ſtate of the Queſtion, by complicating ſeverall diſtinct Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; Theſe I have untwiſted &amp; they reſolve themſelves into three Queſtions, Of the <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> in every Commonwealth, Of the Lawes ſupplying the Defect of it, Of the <hi>Agrarian</hi> as it is ſtated in <hi>Oceana.</hi> To each of which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately.</p>
               <p>I do not intend to be ſo far carryed out of the way by keeping Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> Company, as in this place once more to repeat the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Ballance;</hi> It will be enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect how in that Chapter it has been proved, Firſt That Riches do put in part, &amp; that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly upon the <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> conſtitutes Propriety, conduce to Empire; And ſecondly, That ſo far as Riches doe conduce to Empire, it is to be underſtood indifferently of all ſorts of Riches and not to be reſtrained to Propriety
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43887:74"/> or the <hi>Ballance</hi> in Land unleſs in ſuch places where there is no conſiderable Wealth but what ariſes immediately from the Revenue or Cultivation of Land. This I might juſtly plead as a Privilege to exempt Me from handling this Chapter, ſeeing Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Propoſitions about an <hi>Agrarian</hi> are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Materiall, then upon a ſuppoſition that his Doctrine of the <hi>Ballance</hi> remains firme and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confuted.</p>
               <p>Yet not to refuſe any leap Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> ſets Me, I will in the firſt place examine <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> opinion of the <hi>Ballance,</hi> whom Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> does here pretend to bring to his ſide by help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tranſlation a little.

               <p>Having thus traduced <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the next <note place="margin">ibid.</note> place he does as much for the Conſiderer, whom he accuſes for <hi>throwing onely at Iſrael Lacedemon and Oceana, when he had ſet him all the Commonwealths in the World.</hi> But is it faire play to ſay He ſet Me that which while now He kept in his ſleeve? Are there in <hi>Oceana</hi> any examples of Commonwealths pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that are pretended to be equall in their <hi>Agrarian,</hi> except <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon?</hi> Is it not expreſly ſaid by him <hi>that Athens and</hi>

                  <hi>Rome were unequall as to their Agrarian, that of Athens being infirm, that of Rome none</hi>

                  <hi>at all?</hi> For thoſe new examples of <hi>Venice, Germanie,</hi> &amp;c. which Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> does at preſent pretend to ſet Me, I may with great Reaſon refuſe to throw at them, as being falſe mony; Not one of them amounting to an example of an <hi>Agrarian,</hi> but at moſt of ſuch Lawes as have been inſtituted to ſupply the Defect of one.</p>
               <p>I paſs on then to make good what has in the Conſiderations been objected againſt the <hi>Agrarian</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> taken in Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> ſence; And that is reducible to theſe Heads. 1. That the Diviſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was not a Politique Inſtitution intended as the Baſis of the Government, but was an Effect of Gods Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that He would give that Land to his ſeed after him; 2. That this is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by the Law of the <hi>Jubile,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies had been a weak proviſion, neare fifty yeares time being by that afforded for any man to multiply his Lot to that Height as would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily have ſubverted the Government; 3. That the Government of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſubſiſted forty five yeares without the pretended <hi>Agrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> 4. And finally, That in the Diviſion the Lots muſt needs have been very unequall, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elſe impoſſible there ſhould on the one ſide have been hereditary Princes of the Tribes, and on the otherſide men ſo extreamly poore as to ſell themſelves for ſlaves.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe propoſitions he playes with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43887:76"/> very wantonly, and askes, <hi>If the Right of an</hi>

                  <hi>Oceaner unto his Land muſt derive from the Promiſe of God unto Abraham?</hi> Now to aske him again, Who ſaies ſo? Is no toying, but very good earneſt. And Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> if he had intended to deale fairely, might perceive He was bound to ſhew, That the like diviſion of the Lands in <hi>Oceana</hi> is neceſſary notwithſtanding there be no ſuch cauſe, as was the promiſe of God unto <hi>Abraham</hi> upon which the Diviſion of <hi>Canaan</hi> inſeperably depended. But he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues his gay Humour, and (as Tumblers divert the Company with an <hi>Hoope)</hi> frisks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Circle, He propoſes the Diviſion of the Lands in <hi>Iſrael</hi> as an equall <hi>Agrarian</hi> on whch their <hi>Popular Government</hi> was founded; He is told by Me, That this diviſion of the Land <note place="margin">Gceanap. 26.</note> look't not at the Government, but followed the promiſe of God unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> And that there is not any Footſtep of the other Defign in the whole Bible. He replies, <hi>That God in ordaining the Ballance of Iſrael having ordained the Cauſe, ordained alſo the Effect which was Popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Thus ſuppoſing at all adventures that <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment</hi> to be <hi>Popular,</hi> he will have the <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> (that he Fancies) to be the Cauſe &amp; Foundation of it, And at the next ſtep to ſhew that this <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> is the Cauſe, He ſuppoſes <hi>Popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to be the <hi>Effect.</hi> What can any Reaſonable man deſire more of a new Beginner? But he muſt pardon Me, I am ſtill upon the ſame Ground; He muſt by ſome expreſs place of Scripture (for that place <hi>Num. 26. 53.</hi> going no farther then
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43887:77"/> Tribes or at moſt then Families fals ſhort of doing it as I have ſhewed Conſid. pag. 57.) prove, That the diviſion of the Lands by Lot was intended for the foundation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Or He muſt not think by ſuch weak and precary Diductions from his own Notion of a <hi>Ballance</hi> to peſwade us that God had any ſuch Deſign in it.</p>
               <p>What he anſwers about the <hi>Jubile</hi> is meere Cavilling; For it belongs not to Me to ſhew how in fifty yeares one Lot might be ſo increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as to ſubvert the <hi>Government,</hi> but to him to ſhew that the poſſibility of this was prevented by the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law contained in the <hi>Jubile.</hi> Yet a man may without giving occaſion to be <note place="margin">H. p. 86.</note> accuſed of boaſting, own <hi>Mathematiques</hi> enough to demonſtrate how if not one, yet a few men (which as to to the preſent ſubject creates no Difference) might come to be owners of the whole Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> in the tme between two <hi>Jubiles.</hi> For the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being no where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Merchandiſe, let it be ſuppoſed that ſome few of them addicted themſelves to Traffique, and by the ſucceſs of it annually improved their eſtates twenty in the hundred, which a mong Merchants is not reputed an immoderate gaine. The increaſe of 20 per <hi>Cent.</hi> in 50 yeares which is the diſtance of two <hi>Jubiles,</hi> multiplyes an eſtate 7676 times, as will be manifeſt if in a Geometricall Progreſſion of 50 Terms, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proportion of 100 to 120, or 5 to 6 the laſt Terme be found out. Now the whole Number of Lots in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43887:77"/> 600000, which being divided by 7676 gives Us 78 for the Number of Men who might in the time between two <hi>Jubiles</hi> acquire the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the whole Land. But it is enough to <note place="margin">H. p. 12.</note> poſſeſs three Parts in foure to cauſe an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance, Wherefore Sixty Men might notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>Jubile</hi> come to overballance the reſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and by that overthrow the <hi>Popular Government;</hi> By which it appeares that the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> could not be intended for an <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law, to lie at the Foundation of the <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is his Exception againſt the Argument drawn from that ſpace of 45 yeares during which the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſubſiſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this pretended <hi>Agrarian,</hi> fraught with any honeſter meaning: It is not to be doubted, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> received many Lawes in the Wilderneſs that were not to be put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till after their Settlement in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Of which that was one, <hi>Judges and Officers ſhalt thou make thee in all thy Gates.</hi> But He has taught Us to put a Difference between <note place="margin">H. p. 88.</note> the <hi>Foundation</hi> and the <hi>Superſtructures:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſubſiſted well enough in the Wilderneſs without an Order that depended totally upon their locall Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> This is no Argument that it might do ſo without an Order which is repreſented as Neceſſary and Fundamentall to the <hi>Government.</hi> Before they had Gates, They neither could have nor needed Judges in them, but that does not make the Wonder ceaſe how their <hi>Government</hi> could ſubſiſt 45
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43887:78"/> yeares without an <hi>Agrarian,</hi> if that muſt be reputed the Baſis of their Commonwealth. And whereas Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> ſaies, The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> under <hi>Moſes</hi> were an Army, What is that to purpoſe unleſs this Army muſt be thought to have been governed by Him by Martial Law? Which can never be affirmed by Mr <hi>Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who has made their <hi>Government</hi> beare <note place="margin">Ocean. p. 16.</note> Date, and exemplified in ſome of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Orders of it, ſo many yeares before.</p>
               <p>But all the Conſiderer's Faults have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto but <hi>Peccadillos,</hi> He is now accuſed of no leſs then <hi>taking part with the Divell,</hi> and that <note place="margin">H. pag. 90.</note> for having ſaid He was not aware of any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of Authority belonging to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiſh</hi> more then any other Republique, If any Man will take the Pains to look upon that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Conſiderations pag. 39. He will find two Advantages of Authority expreſly there ſet down by Me, which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> had above all other Commonwealths; If there be any more, Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> would have done Honeſtly to inform Us; But not having been able to do that, and yet to charge Me with the quite contrary of what I aſſerted, will leave it out of Diſpute which of Us <hi>takes part with the Divell,</hi> who We know, <hi>was a Lyer from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as to his Diſtinction of the Power and Authority of a Commonwealth, it is in it ſelf Inſignificant, and as to this Place and Purpoſe, Impertinent; The whole Authority of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Republique is included in thoſe two Points
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43887:78"/> by Me explained in the Conſiderations. And what if the <hi>Romans</hi> being reſolved to erect a Popular Government, to ſave themſelves the pains of contriving, were content to borrow their <hi>Twelve Tables</hi> of the <hi>Athenians?</hi> Muſt We therefore be inforced to have recourſe to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> though We neither have Need of nor Roome for any of their Particular Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? This may give juſt cauſe to ſuſpect his Deſign is to introduce the <hi>Judaicall</hi> Law, And that there is nothing to chooſe between <hi>James Harrington</hi> Legiſlator, and <hi>William Medley</hi> Scribe. Concerning the <hi>Jewiſh Agrarian</hi> then, it is enough that Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Replies to the Conſiderer's Objections are thus manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be unſatisfactory.</p>
               <p>All that is alledged in Oppoſition to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderer's Apprehenſions of the <hi>Lacedaemonian Agrarian</hi> is ſo Inſignificant, that I can have No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to reply; For of Nothing is produced No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I will therefore make uſe of this Leiſure Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> affords Me, to make out a little more fully, from the Hiſtorie of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> my former Aſſertions about the <hi>Agrarian</hi> of that Republique.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lycurgus</hi> when he had begun to new Modell the Commonwealth, finding the greater part of the People to be deſperately Poore, and ſome few very Rich, out of a Deſign to baniſh on the one ſide Envy and Inſidiation, on the other Inſolence and Luxury, and together with theſe, Riches and Poverty, the Mother Diſeaſes of a Commonwealth, He perſwaded them to come
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43887:79"/> to a New and equall Diviſion of Lands; And that for the future they ſhould live upon equall Terms with one another, not aiming at Priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in any thing but Merit, and reputing there ought to be no difference between Man and Man, but what ariſes from the Praiſe of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Reproach of Vice. After He had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh't this, They ſay that paſſing through <note place="margin">ibid.</note> the Countrey in Harveſt, and ſeeing the Shocks of Corne all of a ſize, He ſmiled and ſaid the Countrey look't as if it belonged to Brothers who had newly parted their Inheritance. In ſetting out theſe Lots He ſeems to have look't only at fitting the People, by a bare and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitous Life, for the Trade of War; without that He might have made their Lots as large againe, having Territory enough (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <note place="margin">Plut. in Solon.</note> for twice as many People, the ſurpluſage of which, perhaps, lay waſt, or was injoyed by their Slaves. Nor was it lawfull for any <hi>Spartan</hi> to improve this <hi>Lot</hi> to the beſt, by living upon it, for they were ſtrictly prohibited all Occupations, even that of Agriculture, and their Hinds or <hi>Helots</hi> paid <note place="margin">Plut. in Lyc.</note> them only an Annuall Quantity of Corne, Wine and other Fruits. This Inſtitution had ſerved to little purpoſe, if it had been free for the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians</hi> to poſſeſs what Perſonall Eſtates they thought fit, and therefore <hi>Lycurgus</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving failed in attempting a like Diviſion in Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables) firſt forbid the Uſe of Gold and Silver, and then by the extream debaſing of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Coine, cut off all poſſibility of Traffique
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43887:79"/> with their Neighbours; So that No Man of any Art or Trade tending to Elegancy, Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Luxurie could have any hopes of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Livelyhood at <hi>Sparta:</hi> And withall ſuch Offences as are every where committed out of Deſire of mony, did of themſelves ſoon ceaſe, Mony it ſelf being become of ſo little worth. In all other Points alſo the Inſtitution of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians</hi> was very ſevere, and ſerving meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to accuſtome them during Peace to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities of War. Therefore the Raillery of that <hi>Italian</hi> was ſharp enough, who ſaid <note place="margin">Plut. in Pelop.</note> the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> did no great matter in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo daring in the Wars, if it were only to free themſelves of a laborious and miſerable Life.</p>
               <p>Though theſe things had been with ſo much Care provided for by <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> his Lawes were expoſed to the ſame Fate with thoſe of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Legiſlators, and wanted a Power to make themſelves be obſerved. It was very early, in <hi>Croeſus</hi> time, that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> began to caſt amorous Glances upon Gold, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted by him, they connived at the <note place="margin">Pauſ. Meſſen</note> Slavery he brought upon the <hi>Graecian</hi> Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques in <hi>Aſia.</hi> Their <hi>Agrarian</hi> alſo, ſo far was it from being the Immoveable Baſis of the Commonwealth, was ſoon confounded as well as thoſe of the <hi>Argives</hi> and <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> and that, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> intimates, by the defect of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> his own Lawes; For though <note place="margin">Polit. lib. 2. cap. 9.</note> he forbad Men to alienate their Lots by ſale, He left it free for them to give
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43887:80"/> and bequeath what they thought fit. So that <note place="margin">Ariſt. P ol lib. 5. c. 7.</note> during the <hi>Meſſeniac</hi> War, a ſedition was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of them who demanded a new Diviſion of the Lands. I know that is generally held theſe innovations were of a much later Date, &amp; <hi>Plutarch</hi> names <hi>Epitadeus</hi> one of the <hi>Ephores</hi> as author of them, But the obligation is Mr <note place="margin">Plut. in Agid.</note> 
                  <hi>Harrington's</hi> not mine, to reconcile theſe Authors. However it is manifeſt, that this Breach in their Laws was ſoon taken, for they preſerved themſelves in the Integrity of their Manners and Inſtitution, till after the taking of <hi>Athens</hi> by <hi>Lyſander.</hi> But the Booty gained in that War being very great, <hi>Lyſander</hi> prevailed, that the Gold and Silver might be brought to <hi>Sparta</hi> for the erecting a Publique Treaſury, without which it would be impoſſible to carry on the Deſign of making themſelves the Captaines and Leaders of all <hi>Greece.</hi> This was with ſome reluctancy conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, yet not without this previous Caution, That the mony ſhould ſerve only for Publique Uſes, and that it ſhould be Death for any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man to have Gold or Silver in his houſe, which Law was put in Execution upon the perſon of <hi>Thorax,</hi> But it was in vaine to forbid <note place="margin">Plut. in Lyſand.</note> that in Private, which was allowed in Publique; For with the poſſeſſion of mony imediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Covetouſneſs; &amp; after that an inclination to Eaſe and Luxurie, which preſenly overthrew the ſober and maſculine temper of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. Inſtead of that Probity toward their Friends and Neghbours which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43887:80"/> their Poverty, now Pride, Inſolence and Avarice took Place. So that becoming weake &amp; Effeminate at home, &amp; Odious abroad, their Commonwealth ſoon fell from all its Virtue and Glory. And this ſhewed the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> who knowing that the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their ſcant Lots was not a ſufficient. Bar to the miſchiefs produced by Riches, had at the beginning condemned the uſe of Gold and Silver; for theſe miſeries befell the State a good while before they grew ſo expert at breaking of Lawes as to violate their <hi>Agrarian.</hi> At length that went after the Reſt, and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth being totally abandoned to Luxurie and Corruption (having firſt made a weak attempt or two to revert to her ancient Diſcipline) came to utter Ruine.</p>
               <p>Thus have I given you a <hi>Crayon</hi> of the Commonwealth of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> in reference to her <hi>Agrarian;</hi> Which appeares to have been inſtituted by <hi>Lycurgus:</hi> only as a neceſſary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for attaining that Poverty and Virility, which he intended to incorporate with his Commonwealth. Againſt this Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> will ſcarſe have any more to object then he has done already, which is in effect juſt Nothing. He brings indeed <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> to a falſe Muſter, but <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has been already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued from his Abuſes, and the Place of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> is the ſame (excepting only his want of ſincerity in citing it) with that I firſt produced in this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I am now delivered from this firſt Queſtion
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43887:81"/> of the <hi>Agrarian,</hi> and, according to the Method I propoſed, the ſecond Queſtion which belongs to Such Lawes as ſupply the Defect of an <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> in ſeverall Commonwealth's, comes to be diſcuſſed; In doing which I ſhall not have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpend much Time.</p>
               <p>The firſt Inſtance Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> gives, is of <note place="margin">H. pag. 86.</note> the <hi>Oſtraciſm which ſupplied the Defect in the Graecian Cities of an Agrarian.</hi> That the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraciſm</hi> was not inflicted upon Men for their exceſſive Riches, ſo much as for diminiſhing the Power and Credit which by their Virtue and Great Actions They had attained to in the Commonwealth, I have already made appear; And by Conſequence Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Fancie that it ſupplied the Defect of an <hi>Agrarian</hi> taken in his Senſe muſt needs be without Ground. To which it will only be needfull to adde, that when the <hi>Athenians</hi> thought of putting <hi>Nicias</hi> to the <hi>Oſtraciſm,</hi> (then the Richeſt Subject of <hi>Greece,</hi> and moſt obnoxious to a Law that ſtudied to prevent exceſs of Wealth) their Motives were, His reſerved, ſtately, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popular Manner of Life, together with his Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in adhering to the Publique Good, and oppoſing the raſh Deſires of the People: And though his Riches alſo are mentioned by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> among the reſt, yet ſo as that they were the Object of their Envy rather then their Fear. I wonder why Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> who goes off Fiſt after every Flie, did not mention the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliſm</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> as well as the <hi>Oſtraciſm</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> in imitation of which it was invented:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43887:81"/> But it is to be preſumed he abſtained from it becauſe of the Succeſs, which diſcovered how pernicious this Device was to the Publique. For upon the Inſtitution of this Law, the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſans</hi> of better Quality (a People, it ſeems, not of ſo unquiet and enterprizing a Temper as the <hi>Athenians)</hi> who by their Wiſdome and Experience were capacitated to have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Commonwealth, retired themſelves from all Publique Affaires, thereby to avoid the danger of Baniſhment. And ſo the Care of the Publique being abandoned to the moſt indigent and Impudent Perſons, who took <note place="margin">Diod. Sic. lib. 11.</note> care of nothing but how to ſlatter the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their Orations, the Commonwealth was plunged into ſo many Diſorders and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that there was no hopes of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, unleſs by repealing the <hi>Petaliſm,</hi> to invite Men of worth to reſume the Conduct of Affaires.</p>
               <p>For what concerns the <hi>Agrarian</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> has long ſince ſaid it was <hi>none at</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ocean. p. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>all,</hi> and in effect ſaies now the ſame; For if They did but ſtrive for it, it is evident they never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it.</p>
               <p>That at <hi>Venice</hi> the Officers of the <hi>Pomp</hi> ſhould ſupply the Defect of an <hi>Agrarian,</hi> will ſcarſe be believed by him, who knows how ſlightly the Accurate <hi>Giannotti</hi> paſſes over the Deſcription of that Office. I think alſo it will not be eaſy to comprehend how a Law that preſerves the <hi>Nobility</hi> from laying themſelves out upon vain and Gawdy. Apparencies ſhould tend to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43887:82"/> their Eſtates. But, he ſaies, <hi>a Venetian that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. pag 86.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhould keep a Table or have his houſe furniſht with Retainers would be obnoxious.</hi> Does any <hi>Italian</hi> affect that expenſive way of Popularity? Or how ſhould a <hi>Noble Venetian</hi> need to do it, when he may notwithſtanding entertain in Penſion eight or ten <hi>Bravos?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Follow him to the <hi>German Republiques,</hi> and You will find <hi>they have no more to ſupply the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this Law, then that Eſtates deſcending are divided among the Children: And grant this in Oceana, and You grant the whole Agrarian.</hi> By theſe <hi>Republiques</hi> ſure We are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Nuremberg, Strasburg,</hi> &amp;c. but the Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſes of <hi>Auſtria, Saxonie,</hi> the <hi>Rhine,</hi> &amp;c. all which maintain this Cuſtome: But theſe are all <hi>Monarchies</hi> by a <hi>Nobility,</hi> or at leaſt Members of that Great one the Empire. Wherefore Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> commits a great Error in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the <hi>German Agrarian,</hi> or has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred a far greater one in his Modell of a Commonwealth, in propoſing that <hi>Agrarian</hi> as fit for an equall <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> which by his own Confeſſion belongs to a <hi>Monarchy</hi> by <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this brings Me to the third Queſtion, concerning the <hi>Agrarian</hi> as it is ſtated in <hi>Ocea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> Which as it has no community with that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the originall of its inſtitution, ſo has it very little Reſemblance with that of <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemon</hi> in the aime and Method of its Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This was acknowledged long ſince by the Conſiderer, and Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> could not
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43887:82"/> but ſee it, though He makes ſo pitifull an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to miſtake my Meaning. But I am at a Loſs; The Dialect of the next Pages makes Me think I am fallen into the Company of Cheats, And that it is not <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Plutarch</hi> that can now bring Me off, but that the late Act of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> againſt Gaming muſt do it. This is at leaſt made evident by it, That Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> is converſant in the Myſteries of other Boxes beſides Ballotting Ones, and is no leſs Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for Secretary to the Comb-makers Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, then to a Commonwealth. I envy not his high endowments, but I muſt ſoberly let him know, that though, while he maintains the Dignity of a Philoſopher, and a Gentleman, I count my ſelf obliged to return him a Serious Anſwer, When he thinks fit to play the Buffoon, I can laugh as unconcernedly as any other Man. And to Laughter only (my Pity excepted) am I diſpoſed by ſeeing how he diſports himſelf in ſhaking the 15 falſe Dice he pretends to find in one of my Throwes: Gentlemen, (for it is neceſſary I ſhould appeale to the Lookers on) the Dice I threw were all true, for which he has in taking them up, ſet down theſe Falſe Ones; Not any one of thoſe 15 Abſurdities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Me, but are all framed by himſelf, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a willing Miſtake of my meaning, or by a childiſh Diſtortion of my Words. My firſt Argument therefore, That his Modell of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grarian</hi> is unjuſt, remains unconfuted, and is not ever to be anſwered by any Man who, like Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> makes Propriety the Ground <note place="margin">H. p. 93.</note>

He ventures indeed to ſay, that his <hi>Agrarian</hi> does not alter Propriety, but only obliges a great landed Man to divide it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Children: But he ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that the Liberty of diſpoſing as a Man thinks fit of his own, is Eſſentiall to the Propriety We now Diſpute of; And if it be the Piety of dividing the land among all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren he is taken with, his Hypocriſie may be a little ſuſpected, in regard he has made this Law only to concern the Surpluſage of 2000l. p. an.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument which in the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations I made uſe of againſt the <hi>Agrarian</hi> of <hi>Oceana</hi> was this, That the Rate of 2000. l. p. an. at which it is ſtated can never be fixt, but that it will continually be in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill brought lower, till at length it be ſo far debaſed, That the keeping it from going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lower will be the Concernment of a greater Number of Men, then They make up who have an Intereſt in the further debaſing of it. This Argument Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> has thought ſit to anticipate, by pretending to anſwer it in his eight Chapter. I muſt therefore go back to that Place, which I find to be not only diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, but ſo ſtrangely ſhattered, that it will be very hard for Me to Splinter up the broken confuſed Pieces of it. But to make as much of his Anſwer as I can, He ſeems to ſay in the firſt Place, <hi>That the People are naturally inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>of ſuch a Deſign as Levelling or reducing the Standard of Eſtates to the loweſt Rate, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43887:83"/> never any People (except a faint Attempt of the Romans) went about it; And if there be any ſuch thing familiar with the Nature of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, why appeared it but once, and vaniſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Effect?</hi> This Method of arguing <hi>à non eſſe ad non poſſe,</hi> or affirming becauſe a Thing has not yet been it can never be, is peculiar to Mr <hi>Harrington;</hi> But there is ſome reaſon to doubt, other men will not look upon this as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Security, eſpecially if They conſider how the <hi>People</hi> are now taught Principles before unknown to them, <hi>That the Ballance of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Land is the Naturall Cauſe of Empire,</hi> And <hi>That the Ballance ought to be fixt by an Agrarian Law.</hi> For in <hi>Oceana</hi> every Man (who is not a Servant) above 18 yeares of age being obliged to have Armes, and every Man above 30 being capable of Magiſtracy, the People finding the Empire in their own hands, muſt of neceſſity conclude the <hi>Ballance</hi> ought to be there too, and conſequently muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to take down the ſtandard of the <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> ſo low as that the Land may come to be divided among the whole Body of the People. And if the People in other <hi>Governments, for Example under the late Monarchy, did never</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. pag. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo much as think of Levelling the Nobility,</hi> It was partly becauſe They did not then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, as They will do now, to be a thing juſt and neceſſary; And partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe They wanted Power to do it, their Arms depending upon the <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> And their Vote in the Commons houſe being inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43887:84"/> without the Conſent of the King and Lords. But in the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Oceana</hi> the People can not want Power and Intereſt to effect it, either by the way of Arms or Vote: By the way of Arms, the People amounting to 200000 armed Men, with Commanders and Officers choſen by themſelves out of their own Body, and having a certain <hi>Rendezvous</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in reference to their Muſters, need but declare their Reſolution to have the <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> taken down to a leſs Rate then 2000l. p. an. And the whole Buſineſs is diſpatch't. For They who can have an Intereſt to keep it up at that Rate, not being above 5000 Men, can not poſſibly reſiſt ſo much a greater Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that is already armed and formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Body. So that the People of <hi>Oceana</hi> ought not to be deterred from this Attempt by the Feare of a Civill War, and the Loſs they may ſuſtain by it, (Though, by the way, If that Reflection were enough to keep the People Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uet, there would be little need ever to feare their ſtirring) ſeeing the 5000 Men can not do otherwiſe then immediatly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, as being apparently too weak to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves in the State of War. But if the People of <hi>Oceana</hi> chooſe rather to manage this Deſign by the way of Vote, They may with more eaſe effect it; For the Elders or Men capable of Magiſtracy in <hi>Oceana,</hi> being 100000 in number, And they who poſſeſs 2000l. p. an. being but 5000 in number, The ſame Proportion, according to an equall
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43887:84"/> Calculation, muſt hold in the Deputies at the <hi>Prerogative Tribe;</hi> Wherefore in the <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative</hi> or <hi>Prerogative Tribe</hi> there will be twenty for one who will have an Intereſt to Vote the <hi>Agrarian</hi> down to a lower Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard. Yet I do not think that this will come to abſolute Levelling, or giving to every Man (as Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> computes it) ten pounds <note place="margin">H. pag. 45.</note> a yeare; But I do not ſee how it is poſſible it ſhould ſtay ſooner then at about 200 pounds a yeare; But that being made the meaſure of the <hi>Agrarian,</hi> or the greateſt Eſtate which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man can poſſeſs in Land, there can not be leſs then 50000 Perſons concerned to keep it from going lower, which number will, it is likely, prove conſiderable enough to fix it at that Rate.</p>
               <p>In his Anſwer to my third Argument, He takes Pleaſure in ſtraying out of a plain Way, and will underſtand Me as if I had ſaid, The old <hi>Jewes</hi> during their being Inhabitants of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> were great Traders. I am not aware that any Ambiguity in my Words could give him an Occaſion of this Thought; But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, I am content to explaine my ſelf better by declaring that I meant this of the Modern <hi>Jewes,</hi> who though diſpoſſeſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> are every where ſo Rich, that unleſs perhaps in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, their Anceſtours could never have compared Eſtates with them. And as They having no Land are all Merchants, ſo in <hi>Oceana</hi> the Poſſeſſion of Land being limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Men who aimed at farther Riches or
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43887:85"/> Power, would convert their ſtock into Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, by which <hi>Emporium</hi> would be increaſt beyond the Proportion conſiſting with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> Theſe were the Conſiderer's thoughts, which Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> ſeems not to diſallow of, but only in the laſt particular, that the greatneſs of <hi>Emporium</hi> can prove dangerous to the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana.</hi> To make this Probable, I muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a Good way off. Of <hi>Commonwealths</hi> both Antient and Modern, ſome have been founded upon one Great City, in which are Reſident not only the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Senate,</hi> but alſo the whole Body of the <hi>People</hi> which conſtitues the <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> Such were of old, <hi>Athens, Syracuſe, Carthage, Rome,</hi> at preſent <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa.</hi> Theſe Cities are both the Heart and Head of their ſeverall <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> In them the Principall Actions of Life are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and from thence Bloud and Spirits are conveyed into all the Parts: Their Increaſe is the Augmentation of the whole, and as long as they continue in Health, the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> can not die. Hereupon have all wiſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators contrived and incouraged the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of theſe Cities both in Population and Riches, for the whole <hi>Commonwealth</hi> being in a manner comprehended within their Walls, their inlargement can never cauſe any ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality or Danger to the Publique. If it be <note place="margin">Ocean. p. 147 H. p. 98.</note> thought that I commit an Error in placing <hi>Rome</hi> in this Claſſis of <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> ſeeing her Ruſtick Tribes were the moſt conſiderable
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43887:85"/> both for number and Reputation. My induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to it were, Firſt that at the Inſtitution of the Ruſtick Tribes they were ſo neere adjacent to the City, that there was ſcarſe any difference, as to the facility of Aſſembling together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Inhabitants of the City it ſelf; And then ſecondly, That before <hi>Rome</hi> had attained any conſiderable Greatneſs, the Tribes were no longer to be taken in a Locall accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but only as ſo many diviſions of the <hi>People,</hi> to ſome one of which every Citizen where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever inhabiting muſt neceſſarily relate; As with us every freeman of <hi>London</hi> muſt be of ſome one of the old Companies. And it was in this ſenſe that the <hi>Patricians</hi> choſe to be of ſome Ruſtick Tribe, which is no more then that my <hi>Lord Major</hi> is a Skinner or a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Taylor. But thirdly though <hi>Rome</hi> had her Ruſtick Tribes, and <hi>Athens</hi> her <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Populations in the Country, none of theſe had Right to aſſemble within their own precincts, for chooſing Magiſtrates or nominating Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to repreſent them, nor had any capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of dealing in Publique Affaires, unleſs They in perſon repaired to the Capitall City, ſo that this City ſtill remained the Seat of the Commonwealth, all Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Buſineſs being tranſacted within her Walls.</p>
               <p>Other <hi>Commonwealths</hi> have not been raiſed upon the greatneſs of one City, but have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of the Confederacy or League of many, of which ſort ſo many examples occur among the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43887:86"/> 
                  <hi>Grecians</hi> it is needleſſe to name any; Of Modern ones the Union of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Provinces is of this Nature. And in this caſe no one City can acquire an extraordinary Greatneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger to the Liberties of all the reſt, or at leaſt of Diſſolution to the Union: Thus the City of <hi>Thebes</hi> being grown Powerfull, took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Liberty of the <hi>Boeotians</hi> their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates: And thus the <hi>Elians</hi> being inrich't by the Conflux of People to the <hi>Olympian Games,</hi> incroch't upon the Privileges of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Towns. That <hi>Amſtredam</hi> of late yeares hugely advanced by Traffique, is in a Condition to do as much for the United States; and has in part attempted it, was intimated by the Conſiderer: The Actions are freſh, and thoſe Relations and Diſcourſes which are Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, make every man a judge; If Mr <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> be ſatisfyed that <hi>their actions reſiſted not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 98.</note> 
                  <hi>the Interest of Liberty, but of a Lord,</hi> He may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a penſion in communicating this ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them of <hi>Zealand, Frizeland</hi> and <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſſell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third ſort of Commonwealths are thoſe which conſiſt not of Leagues or Unions, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are ſeated in ſome one great City, but are diffuſed through a whole Nation, and are not to be aſſembled but by the Mediation of a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative Body: Of this kind you are not to expect many Examples; <hi>Iſrael</hi> (when it ſhall be evinced to have been a Commonwealth) muſt needs have been ſuch an one, and ſuch an one is the propoſed Modell of a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> for
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43887:86"/> 
                  <hi>Oceana.</hi> In theſe the diſproportionate Greatneſs of any one City, becomes ſtill more dangerous, for now this City is no longer to be reputed the Head or Heart, but the Spleen or Liver, whoſe overgrowth brings the reſt of the Body to Decay or Ruine. Any one City ſo overtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Reſt conſtitutes <hi>Rem-publicam</hi> in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica,</hi> and the Inhabitants of it will alwaies ſtand united in reference to their own Intereſt even when it looks a ſquint upon that of the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> In <hi>Iſrael</hi> indeed they need not to feare this Inconvenience, for it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that before the eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> any one City had ſo much advantage over the reſt as to claim the Dignity of a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis.</hi> But in <hi>Monarchies</hi> the Miſchief has been frequent; <hi>Paris</hi> both formerly and in our time has been the Riſe and Retreat of ſeverall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, <hi>Ghendt</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi> have more then once done as much for their Princes, In <hi>Spain</hi> the War <hi>de las Communidades</hi> took its beginning from <hi>Toledo, Valladolid, Valentia</hi> and two or three more great Towns. And that the miſchief ſhould be multiplyed in a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> I have one reaſon more to think, wch is that a <hi>Monarch</hi> can by the Reſidence of his Court, that brings ſo ample profit to a City, lay an obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, which in a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> can amount to very little, or rather Nothing. To make an end, the City of <hi>Emporium</hi> is already ſo Potent That it may will be doubted whether ſhe will be content with that portion Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> has allowed her in his <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Oceana,</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:43887:87"/> and whether when ſhe looſes the Honor of obeying a Prince, ſhe will not think her <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Councell</hi> as good as the <hi>Prerogative Tribe,</hi> and her <hi>Commander in Chiefe</hi> as the <hi>Strategus of Oceana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore thoſe of the Nobility who have diſpoſed of their Sons in the City may fairely expect to ſee them Princes, The reſt may doe well to conſider whether the Beare's skin will keep them warme while it is upon the Beares back, and whether they can live upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of thoſe Eſtates Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <note place="margin">H. p. 100.</note> them in the firſt Provinces his <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> conquers.</p>
               <p>The fourth Argument was taken from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of making the <hi>Agrarian</hi> equall and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in reference to the inconſtant value of mony: But this ſaies He, <hi>was ſufficiently provided for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 101.</note> 
                  <hi>where it is ſaid that a new ſurvey at the preſent Rent being taken, the Agrarian ſhould ordain that no man ſhould thenceforth hold above ſo much Land as there is valued at the rate of 2000l. per an.</hi> Though this was omitted in the Order, I deny not that it was hinted in one of the ſpeeches; but this is to recompence one errour by committing another that is greater, or to cure an Ague by a Feavour; The value of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'tis true is alwaies in motion, but not in ſo ſwift and irregular one, as the Improvement of Land I ſpeak not of the improvement of Rent, or the advantage the Landlord makes upon the Farmer, but of that Naturall one which ſometimes conſiſt in the Meliorating of the ſoile
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43887:87"/> it ſelf, as by derivation of Water; Sometimes in the Diſcovery of a profitable Minerall; And ſometimes by imploying the ground to a new Husbandry as the planting Tabacco, Hops, and many other things which have already and may for the future be invented. By all theſe waies, the value of Land may come to be many times multiplyed, and conſequently the <hi>Agrarian</hi> notwithſtanding this Proviſion muſt ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from the firſt Deſign of its inſtitution. He need not now have been put in mind of this, if he would have learn't this Leſſon of <hi>Ariſtotle, That thoſe Orders in a Commonwealth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pol. lib. 5. cap. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>which relate to the Cenſus or Valuation of Eſtates, muſt be renewed and adapted continually to the Cenſus through all its ſhiftings and Changes, and this at furtheſt once in five yeares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>Agrarian</hi> does not ſtem, but follow the Tide of Cuſtome in this Nation, will ſcarſe meet with Belief, notwithſtanding Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> undertaking, as long as We have before our eyes ſo many examples of Elder Brothers and great Purchaſers. But I mean not to trouble him with any Diſcourſes about keeping or breaking old Cuſtomes; That would be as to this ſubject but a Common place of talke, and if the <hi>Agrarian</hi> be a thing ſo cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, his paines in diſcovering of it, merit the leſs of thanks from the Publique; For thogh we uſually give Mony to thoſe who ſhew Us an Hare or Patridge, it has not been made a faſhion to reward ſuch as bring Us to a Crow or a Jack-Daw.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:43887:88"/>

                  <hi>unto Government be it what it will, and as much to Kings as unto Commonwealths,</hi> I can not give my aſſent; The Reaſons of my not doing ſo, have been made out abundantly, unleſs I have had the ill fortune to throw away all that has been ſaid in this Chapter and that of the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.</hi> I doe not deny that theſe Notions are of good concernment, if taken in generall, and without this ſevere Reſtriction to Eſtates in Land. I lay it for a ground that Princes ought to conſider Riches as one of the principall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Governing; That in order to this They ſhould not think a Crown worth wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, unleſs provided with a Conſtant Revenue, (or at leaſt a way of raiſing it) large enough for all Publique Occaſions; That they weare the Key of their Treaſury, with the ſame Jealouſy as their Sword, permitting neither to be taken out of their own hands. For the reſt, That they take care thoſe men whoſe intereſt is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant upon the Prince's may be poſſeſt of ſuch eſtates as ſhall bring them a Returne of Reſpect and Power. The favour of the Prince, the Profit of Offices, the Advantages ariſing from Publique Imployment both Military and of State, joyned with other Arts of Governing, will in a <hi>Monarchy</hi> put faire for attaining this, without the neceſſity of an <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law: Nor on the other ſide does a Prince ſtand in need of that help to abate the Power of any Subject that is grown dangerous, but is readily preſented with ſome more ſilent way of effecting it from
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43887:88"/> the preſent Juncture of Buſineſs. And indeed univerſally <hi>Monarchies</hi> have this advantage over <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> that <hi>Commonwealths</hi> are like Engines which being wound up can not in the greateſt neceſſity vary from the Deſignation of the Artificer, but <hi>Monarchies</hi> are animate Bodies, moving and acting according to all exigencies by vertue of their own Soules: The former like the wooden Eagle which met the Emperour limited in her flight by the will of the Engineer, The other has Wings of her own, and when ſhe ſees the Quarry, failes not to make a gallant flight.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether Courſes or Rotation be neceſſary to a well ordered Commonwealth, &amp;c.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN this long Chapter the Conſiderer has a very ſmall ſhare. It is intended againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of People who though they are paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Doters on a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> profeſs to diſlike the Introduction of a <hi>Rotation.</hi> This has proceeded ſo far as to cauſe a Schiſme among the <hi>Commonwealths-Men,</hi> For whilſt ſome of them think that without the <hi>Rotation</hi> a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> muſt (like <hi>Pharoah's</hi> Chariots) clog and drive heavily; others ſuſpect this continnall whirling would produce nothing but giddineſs and a Danger of overturning. Yet there is ſome
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43887:89"/> Reaſon to doubt this Difference is not rooted in their Judgements ſo much as in their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts: They who expect to fill a place in a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Counſell, are not pleaſed to think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning, after a certain Terme, their Cuſhions to new Commers; But ſuch who deſpaire of that advantage, rather then be wholly ſhut out would willingly take Turns, governing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the Advice of our wiſe Anceſtors, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be content with halfe a Loafe then have no Bread.</p>
               <p>But this being matter of conjecture, I will let it paſs, left I happen to miſtake their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much as Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> does mine; Who all along this Chapter treats me as one of thoſe who maintain a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> while ſhe is fixt upon ſtanding Counſels and Armies, to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordered then when ſhe goes upon <hi>Rotation.</hi> But this is manifeſt; That I concede <hi>Rotation</hi> to have been the practiſe of Ancient <hi>Republiques,</hi> and I doe not any where diſcover that I think a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> can be ſafe without it. It is true that judging <hi>Rotation</hi> to be in it ſelf not very juſt, and often prejudiciall to publique Affairs, I can not approve of that Government which ſtands in need of ſuch an Order; ſo that my Quarrell lyes not againſt <hi>Rotation</hi> where I find it in a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> but againſt <hi>Commonwealths</hi> becauſe they are by the neceſſary care of their Preſervation, forced to embrace <hi>Rotation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Examples therefore of <hi>Iſrael, Athens</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> do not any way concern Me: Though it were an eaſie matter to ſhew that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43887:89"/> the Proofs of a <hi>Rotation</hi> in <hi>Iſrael</hi> are very wild and unconcluding, if I had not an Obligation upon Me to abſtain from inquiring any further into that Government. Concerning <hi>Venice,</hi> as He has brought forth nothing that's new to one who is not a ſtranger to <hi>Giannotti,</hi> ſo will his Riddle eaſily meet with a Solution out of that Author. If he would make 2 or 3 dozen of theſe Riddles, and put them into Rime, (which to him cannot be difficult) if they did not pleaſe the Counſell of State, they would at leaſt be admirably uſefull to the new <hi>Junta</hi> of Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Ladies, who by them would find Diverſion for Winter Evenings, without deſcending from the Gravity of their new affected ſtudies, <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All then that I need to do is to make good this Aſſertion, That <hi>Commonwealths</hi> have by the Obſervation of their <hi>Rotation</hi> been put upon great and Dangerous Inconveniences. To prove this the Examples of <hi>Veturius, Varro, Mancinus</hi> and other weak and paſſionate Commanders imployed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> were inſiſted on by the Conſiderer: Which Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets moſt extravagantly as <hi>if there were but</hi>

                  <hi>three weake or unfortunate Generals in the whole courſe of Rome.</hi> He that names three, with the addition of a generall clauſe comprehending the reſt, is not, I conceive, with any Honeſty to be underſtood, as if he thought there were but three in all. If it be any pleaſure to Mr <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> to view a Liſt of unfortunate <hi>Roman</hi> Generals, let him caſt his eyes upon the <hi>Fabii,</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:43887:90"/> 
                  <hi>Sulpitius Longus Q. and P. Servilius, Claudius Pulcher, Sempronius, C. Flaminius, Vitilius, Plautius, Popilius, Manilius, Lentulus, Piſo, Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeus, L. Caſſius, Scaurus, Coepio, Rutilius,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more which might be reckoned up if it were my deſign to count the black daies in the <hi>Roman</hi> Calendar. I ſelected thoſe three becauſe by their want of Experience and Conduct <hi>Rome</hi> received the greateſt and moſt ignominious defeats that ever befell Her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Veturius</hi> (or <hi>Poſthumius</hi> if he will needs lay the miſcarriage chiefly upon him) threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way himſelf and the <hi>Roman</hi> Army very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly; For having taken no Care, by Spies or Intelligence of his own, to be informed of the Poſture and Condition of the Enemy, He relied wholly upon the Report of Priſoners, which <note place="margin">Liv. lib. 9.</note> is alwaies uncertain and very often Suborned. Being thus put upon a long March with a thought to find that Enemy at <hi>Luceria</hi> who was then cloſe by him, he engaged the Army in a deep Valley ſhut up on every ſide with ſteep Rocks and thick Foreſts, acceſſible only by two narrow and difficult Paſſages: And here he committed an Error far more groſs and withall irreparable; For either he did omit, contrary to the known Maximes of War, to diſcover the Countrey through which his March lay, or knowing it (as is more probable) he negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, by a ſtrange Stupidity, to ſecure himſelf of either of the two Paſſes; So that finding the furtheſt guarded and barricadoed by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, before he could get back the other was
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43887:90"/> ſurprized alſo, and the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Army caught in this Trap. Now it is evident that this loſs befell the <hi>Romans,</hi> not by the Valour or Experience of their Enemies, but meerly by the Inſufficiency of their own Commanders, who probably had never been imployed, but for the Orders of their <hi>Rotation;</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth had at that time <hi>Fabius, Papyrius,</hi> and many other brave Commanders, who in ſubmitting to the <hi>Rotation</hi> were fain to reſign the Conduct of the Army to ſuch raw Men as could Court the Suffrages of the People for the <hi>Conſulſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Varro,</hi> it is obſervable that his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (like that of <hi>Flaminius</hi> the Conſul of the <note place="margin">Liv. lib. 22.</note> former yeare who loſt the great Battle at the Lake of <hi>Thraſimene)</hi> was carried meerly upon a Faction againſt the <hi>Nobility,</hi> without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Merit in the Perſon, then his Sycophantry in accuſing the Conduct of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to <hi>the People</hi> in promiſing them to put a ſudden end to the War: In his yeare was that Stupendous defeat received at <hi>Cannae</hi> which is by <hi>Polybius</hi> wholly imputed to his ill Manage We may fairely take notice that the Dangers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo often precipitated du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the War with <hi>Annibal,</hi> took their Riſe from the frequent Change of Commanders; For there is juſt ground in the Hiſtories of thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of believing that if <hi>Scipio</hi> the elder, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> or <hi>Marcellus</hi> had had the ſole manage of the War, <hi>Hannibal</hi> could never have ſetled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in <hi>Italie,</hi> but being conſumed by want and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43887:91"/> ſmall Skirmiſhes muſt preſently have abandoned the Countrey; Whilſt on the other hand, the Commanders being changed every yeare, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced Men came to be at the head of the Army, who hoping to get Honour, at the Charges of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> put things upon the hazardous Iſſue of ſet Battles And this is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and directly to be charged upon their Orders of <hi>Rotation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Hoſtilius Mancinus,</hi> the foulneſs of his miſcarriage appeares in this, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 30000 Men he was defeated by 4000. <hi>Numantines;</hi> And that the fault was only in the Generall, was the Judgment of the <hi>Romans</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Florus &amp; Brev. Livii. lib. 55. &amp; 57.</note> themſelves, who therefore committing the care of the War to <hi>Scipio</hi> (though expreſly againſt their Lawes of <hi>Rotation)</hi> he made an end of it with the ſame Forces which had been ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beaten. But it can not ſcape our wonder, that Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> ſhould think fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate <note place="margin">H. p. 125.</note> the Guilt of thoſe Miſcarriages to <hi>Pompey the Great,</hi> who had no being in the World till thirty yeare after: It is true that <hi>Q. Pompeius Rufus</hi> received a foile from the <hi>Numantines, Anno <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C.</hi> 616. but by what ſecret Participation of Guilt can this concern <hi>Cn.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C.</hi> 647? We might with equall Juſtice make the Tranſlator of <hi>Virgill</hi> be reſponſible for all the faults in the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Orlando Furioſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus ſufficiently proved that theſe three great Defeats befell the <hi>Romans</hi> meerely
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43887:91"/> through the weakneſs of their Commanders, as alſo that theſe weake Commanders could not, (in all Probability) ever have come into that Imployment but through the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Rotation,</hi> it would be altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to accumulate any more Examples out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Stories. I may then go on to confirm the ſame Obſervation out of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian Hiſtorie;</hi> Which Commonwealth beſides the annuall <hi>Rotation</hi> of her Generals, was good at another Trick often made Uſe of by Republiques out of a Jealouſy of tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting too much Power in one hand: This was to confer the Command, not upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Perſon, but to place it upon many, or in a Commiſſion, ſo that They have frequently had at once in one Army ten Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. At <hi>Aegos-potamos</hi> they were no few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and their Sottiſhneſs as well as their Number conſidered, I can not ſtudy out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Term to fit them ſo properly as that of a Rabble. <hi>Conon</hi> was indeed a brave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, but his ſingle Vote could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile againſt the Obſtinacy of his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. At that time <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was the only <note place="margin">Thueyd. l. 6.</note> Man who had credit and Ability enough to have ſaved the <hi>Athenian</hi> State; But He out of the Peoples Jealouſy of him, and by the Orders of their <hi>Rotation</hi> being laid a ſide, <hi>Tydeus, Philocles,</hi> and as many as ſerved to make up the halfe Score of Generals, were intruſted with the whole Navall Power then remaining to the <hi>Athenian</hi> Commonwealth, <note place="margin">Plut. &amp; Xenoph.</note>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:43887:92"/> which they totally loſt at <hi>Aegos-potamos</hi> by one of the moſt Palpable and wilfull Errors that perhaps, was ever committed in War. It is not to be expected I ſhould bring another Example from the <hi>Athenian</hi> Hiſtorie, ſince this Error was one of thoſe which can not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted twice, and <hi>Athens</hi> it ſelf being a while after taken in Conſequence of this Defeat, They had not any more Fleets or Armies to throw away by their <hi>Rotation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> replies Mr <hi>Harrington, had there been formerly no Rotation in Athens how ſhould there have been Men of Valour and Conduct to lie by the Wals? And if Rotation thenceforth ſhould</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. pag. 125.</note> 
                  <hi>have ceaſed, how could thoſe Men of Valour and Conduct have done other then lie by the Wals? So this unavoidably confeſſeth, that Rotation was the Means whereby Athens came to be ſtored with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Valour and Conduct, and They to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Imployment.</hi> In Anſwer to this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Argument, let Me inquire of him, What <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> was there in the Armies of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands?</hi> Yet we know there was a time when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the able Souldiers of Chriſtendome came out of that Schoole. Or let him ſhow Me the Orders of <hi>Rotation</hi> at preſent in <hi>France,</hi> which Crown notwithſtanding abounds with more Perſons capable of high Commands, then all <hi>Europe</hi> beſides. In ſmall Imployments, it is not <hi>Rotation,</hi> or the paſſing through many hands, that can beget able Men, and in great Actions Men of great Abilities will grow up without the help of <hi>Rotation;</hi> So that if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43887:92"/> or Rome have produced ſuch Illuſtrious</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. pag. 126.</note> 
                  <hi>Examples,</hi> it is very Impertinent to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this to <hi>Rotation</hi> or the <hi>Integrity of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, Suffrage,</hi> but to the great Imployments, in which by reaſon of their continuall Wars, thoſe <hi>Commonwealths</hi> brought up their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>Since He has mentioned the Integrity of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular</hi> Suffrage, it muſt not be let paſs without our Animadverſion, where he ſaies <hi>That the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Ballot bars Canvaſing, beyond all Poſſibility of any ſuch thing.</hi> No doubt the Secrecy introduced by the <hi>Ballot,</hi> is a faire Guardian of Liberty in Voting; but if We examine the matter more narrowly, We ſhall eaſily perceive that this hardly extends to more then a removing the Awe impoſed upon Men by Feare, and that all the Engagements of Affection, Flattery, and Bribery are not in the leaſt weakened by the <hi>Ballot.</hi> And therefore We may juſtly infer that the Orders of <hi>Oceana</hi> are in this point Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, (for the Proviſion in the ninth order fals far ſhort of a Cure) as were thoſe of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> before the Introduction of the <hi>Cenſor's</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: For till then, notwithſtanding the <hi>Ballot,</hi> the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> held ſecret Correſpondences for the mutuall gratifying one another's Ambition, and ſome directly ſold their Votes; which makes <hi>Giannotti</hi> judge, That, without the <hi>Cenſors</hi> who have power given them to prevent it, This ſingle Diſorder had been enough to have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Commonwealth. And conformable to this is the Experience of the <hi>Conclaves</hi> held for
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43887:93"/> Electing of the <hi>Popes,</hi> where ſince <hi>Gregory</hi> the 15, all waies of making the <hi>Pope</hi> are forbid, but that of ſecret Scrutiny which is ſo managed that in effect it is the ſame thing with the <hi>Ballot:</hi> And yet the Examples of ſucceeding <hi>Conclaves</hi>

               <p>To returne to <hi>Rotation,</hi> As the miſchieſs by it derived upon a Commonwealth are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, in the next place I am to ſhow how it has not been counted ſo Sacred, but that it has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been ſacrificed to the Publique Exigencies. <hi>Machiavel</hi> furniſhes Me with the early Example of <hi>Publilius Philo</hi> at <hi>Palepolis.</hi> When the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantines</hi> had by the bravery of their Reſiſtance provoked the Rage and Diſdain of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, not to trifle out the War any longer under weake Commanders, The People gave <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Conſulſhip,</hi> though he were then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of it by the Law of <hi>Rotation</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a Vacation of ten yeares between two <note place="margin">Brev. Liv.</note> 
                  <hi>Conſulſhips.</hi> The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> indeed were more Hypocriticall, while out of ſcruple of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating their <hi>Rotation</hi> they cheated themſelves with the Name and outſide of things; The caſe I refer to was in <hi>Lyſander,</hi> who had in the yeare <note place="margin">Plut. Xenoph.</note> of his Admiralty laid great Deſigns for carrying on the War againſt <hi>Athens,</hi> and rendered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe very acceptable to the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Confederates on the coaſts of <hi>Aſia;</hi> At <hi>Sparta</hi> there was a Law that no man ſhould be twice Admirall, and yet it being highly expedient for
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43887:93"/> their Affaires to give <hi>Lyſander</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand again, They fell upon an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſomewhat ridiculous in the hands of Wiſe men; <hi>Aracus</hi> an inconſiderable Perſon was made Admirall, and <hi>Lyſander</hi> had the Commiſſion of Viceadmirall with the whole Power and authority of Admirall. Such ſhifts are thoſe States put to who think the ſupreame Publique intereſt can be regulated by any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lawes?</p>
               <p>If then the Lawes of <hi>Rotation</hi> have ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently vailed Bonnet to the Ambition or Deſire of Acquiſition in Commonwealths, it cannot ſeem ſtrange they ſhould doe ſo in caſe of neceſſary preſervation. In all the courſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Affaires We can ſcarſe meet with a time more deſtitute of great Actions, and by conſequence of great Commanders, then that immediately following the third <hi>Punick</hi> and <hi>Numantine</hi> Wars: Yet in that time the blackeſt and fierceſt tempeſt broke upon the <hi>Romans</hi> that ever they were expoſed to, except that which ſome hundreds of yeares after ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackt their Empire; The <hi>Cimbres, Teutons,</hi> and <hi>Ambrons,</hi> fierce Northern Nations, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of at leaſt 300000 fighting men; beſides an aequall Company of Women and Children to ſupply them with Recruits, poured themſelves down upon <hi>Italy;</hi> Foure <hi>Roman</hi> Armies had <note place="margin">Plut. in Mar.</note> been defeated by them, nor could the <hi>Alpes</hi> and Winter to boot, be any obſtacle to their March; In this condition what ſhould the <hi>Romans</hi> doe? They had but one Commander
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43887:94"/> 
                  <hi>C. Marius,</hi> to whom in the Publique Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the manage of the War could be with any ſafety committed, And he was at that time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable by the Laws of <hi>Rotation:</hi> Should they violate the Law? Or ſuffer the Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to come up to <hi>Rome</hi> without Oppoſition? The grave Statiſts were for the obſervation of the Law, but here it was the <hi>Peoples</hi> turn to be wiſe, and their feares were their beſt Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. They thought fit to make bold with the Law for the Publique Utility, and gave three Conſulſhips together to <hi>Marius,</hi> in whoſe hands only they counted the Commonwealth ſecure. <note place="margin">Brev.

               </p>
               <p>That this Prolongation of Empire to <hi>Marius,</hi> was the firſt ſtep toward the Deſtruction of the Commonwealth is obſerved by Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> out of <hi>Machiavel;</hi> And yet it is the conſent of <note place="margin">Png. 126, 127, &amp; 128.</note> Hiſtorians that without the help of <hi>Marius</hi> the Commonwealth had then been deſtroyed by the <hi>Cimbres;</hi> This does beyond all Exception fortify my Notion, That a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> is an Imperfect forme of <hi>Government,</hi> ſince ſhe may be reduced to that Exigence as by either obſerving or violating her Lawes to plunge her ſelf into a certain Ruine. If <hi>Machiavel</hi> has obſerved no other <hi>Dilemma</hi> in this, then <hi>That if a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth will not be ſo ſlow in her Acquiſition as is required by Rotation, She will be leſs ſure then is requiſite to her Preſervation,</hi> I am not reſponſible for his Inadvertency: But it was reaſonable for me to expect that Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> when I
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43887:94"/> had preſented him with a paire of Spectacles ſhould have ſeen a little better and have taken notice that the prolongation of Empire to <hi>C. Marius</hi> was not in order to Conqueſt or Acquiſition, but to the Preſervation of <hi>Italie,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>We have all this while advanced very little, if this Flaw which in Reference to <hi>Rotation,</hi> has been diſcovered in <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> be no leſs diſcernable in <hi>Monarchies;</hi> For then it is not a weakneſs ſeated in one Limbe or Member, but a Diſeaſe that has ſeized upon the whole Body of <hi>Government:</hi> And this Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> inſinuates when he tels Us, <hi>That a Prince whoſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">H. p. 129.</note> 
                  <hi>Providence ſupplies not the defect of Rotation with ſomething of like Nature, expoſeth Himſelf if not his Empire as much unto Danger as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi> Here I muſt put him in mind of the Difference, formerly obſerved by Me, between the Actions of a <hi>Prince</hi> and a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> even when they do the ſame Thing. A <hi>Commonwealth</hi> having no eies of her own is forced to reſign her ſelf to the Conduct of <hi>Lawes,</hi> which are blind too, though in a known Road they faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and without wandring performe the part of a Guide; But if a ſtone be laid, or a pit be digged in this Path, the Blind leading the Blind, they both fall, and then ſhe runs a danger of her Neck. If in this Caſe a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> be beholding to ſome hand to lead her to avoid the Danger, it is oddes ſhe will never be able to free herſelf of the new Guide, who carrying her through unknown Waies in the end ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43887:95"/> or ſtrangles her. But a <hi>Prince</hi> having his Eyes about him chuſes his own Way, and though for the Generall he keeps on the High Way of <hi>Lawes,</hi> yet when that leads to a Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, he can ſee how to goe about, till having ſcaped the Danger, he may ſafely returne to the common Road. In diſpoſing then of Publique Imployments a wiſe <hi>Prince</hi> obſerves no other <hi>Rotation</hi> but what is meaſured by the Ability and Integrity of the Perſon's imployed, the preſent Neceſſity and future ſecurity of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, from the due mixture of all which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults the <hi>Princes</hi> behaviour as to the Placing, Diſplacing and Tranſplacing his Publique Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters whether Military or Civill; And all this is performed without being lyable (unleſs by a particular error of the <hi>Princes</hi> Judgment) to miſtake or Danger. Whereas a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> that is tyed up by the Lawes of <hi>Rotation,</hi> knows not how to refuſe the ſervice of her weakeſt Subjects, or to imbrace her moſt Able and Faithfull ones (even in her greateſt Exigencies) during the time of their <hi>Vacation,</hi> unleſs at the ſame moment ſhe open a Gap to the Ambition of ſuch men who will of ſervants indeavour to become her Maſters. And this befalls a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> as ſhee is a <hi>Government of Lawes,</hi> which being framed upon an univerſall proſpect, can not poſſibly, be fitted to particular incident oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; ſo that a Government making profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to regulate it ſelf in all things by <hi>Lawes,</hi> muſt need be ſometimes at a Loſs, and is not unlike the great Land Crabs in ſome parts of <hi>America</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:43887:95"/> which walke alwaies in a ſtrait Line, and will rather then vary from it, climb over an houſe or a Tree.</p>
               <p>To what purpoſe then ſerves the Pompous Enumeration of ſuch <hi>Princes</hi> as have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted <note place="margin">
                     <hi>H.</hi> p. 129.</note> by their Favourites, or depoſed by the Generals of their Armies? Yet it muſt not paſs without Animadverſion, That this Tragicall Liſt is in great Part made up of ſuch Perſons (as <hi>Sejanus, Perennis, Ruffinus Stilico, Walle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein &amp;c.)</hi> whoſe unſuccesfull Ambition ſerves for an excellent Leſſon to keep great men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of Duty and Moderation. But at worſt, if ſome weake and careleſs <hi>Princes</hi> by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the Oportunities of their own Safety, have faln by the hands of ſuch as they truſted, this is no more an argument for <hi>Rotation,</hi> then it would be for going unarm'd becauſe ſome men have been killed by their own ſwords. I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuſpect that upon this occaſion Mr <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> intended a ſecret blow at the Head of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> by ſhewing how lyable that <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is to be ruined by the Uſurpation of ſuch Perſons to whom Princes commit any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Power either in Civill or Military Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. But this he will find to be a common Calamity, not to be prevented by the Orders of any <hi>Government,</hi> but only by the particular Dexterity and Prudence of a <hi>Prince:</hi> I adde not, Or of the Chief Miniſters of a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> becauſe the Cure in a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> is in a manner Deſperate, it being ſcarſe Poſſible that any Citizen ſhould arrive at ſo much Power as
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43887:96"/> to become Dangerous, but that at the ſame time he will have Barricadoed all waies tending to the publique Preſervation, ſince thoſe Counſels where it is to be debated, will be filled with his Friends and Dependents. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may put in the other ſcale, a great Heap of Inſtances of ſuch Commonwealths as have been oppreſt by thoſe Perſons to whom they had committed the conduct of their Affaires.

            <head>AN APPENDIX <hi>By way of reply to what</hi> Mr Harrington <hi>cals A full Anſwer to all Objections.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is a pretty Artifice in Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> to inſinuate that becauſe no man has gone about to diſcover any Contradiction or, Inequality in the Model of his <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> therefore it muſt be taken for granted his <hi>Commonwealth</hi> has not any ſuch in it, and muſt conſequently be void of all Internall cauſes of Diſſolution. By this he indeavours to draw the world into an Opinion that his <hi>Commonwealth</hi> is Invnlnerable, and at the ſame time to fix a Diſreputation upon the Author of the Conſiderations, as if he had failed in making out what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took. For what concerns Me as Author of the Conſiderations, having at the beginning made profeſſion to reſtrain them to the firſt Preliminaries of <hi>Oceana,</hi> Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> is injurious in accuſing Me in neglecting that which was no part of my Buſineſs, and which I alwaies declared I did not intend to meddle with.</p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:43887:98"/>
            <p>But before that other Men make a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Judgement to Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> and believe upon the credit of this Argument that his <hi>Commonwealth</hi> has attained unto full Perfection, It will be convenient They ſhould reflect, That in a Modell of <hi>Government</hi> the Conformity of the ſeverall Parts to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other is not a ſufficient argument of the Perfection of the whole; For as in a Fiction, the ſeverall Members may be ſo contrived as not to give one another the Lie, but be all contained within the limits of veriſimilitude, and yet the whole remain without the leaſt ſyllable of Truth; Or as for the Explication of any Motion in Nature, various Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may be excogitated including no Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity within themſelves, and yet perhaps, not any one of them prove to be the true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Nature; ſo in <hi>Government,</hi> It is not difficult to invent variety of Formes, the parts of each of which taken ſeparately, may maintain a faire Correſpondence and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among themſelves, and yet the Whole be far enough from attaining to Perfection.</p>
            <p>The Materials of <hi>Government</hi> are Mankind, and the Architect wo diſpoſes of theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials is man alſo; ſo that <hi>Government</hi> is nothing elſe but an Art by which one part of Mankind diſpoſes of the other for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Common Utility of both, which conſiſts in ariving at ſuch a Degree of Plenty and Security as Mankind is capable of by
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43887:98"/> ſociety. This Art is not obliged to one ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Method for attaining the End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign propoſed to it, but has ſometimes made uſe of a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> ſometimes of an <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie,</hi> ſometimes of a <hi>Democratie,</hi> and in all theſe of ſeverall Frames and Models. But this art of Governing has a very diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Difference from all other Arts, for in them the Artificer makes choice only of ſuch Materials as have the greateſt aptitude for his worke but in <hi>Government</hi> the Artificer is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to his Materials, and muſt grapple with all the Stubborneſs and Reluctancy He meets with in them; And it is an Error very inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Mankind, that every particular Man thinks <hi>Government</hi> was inſtituted for his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Advantage, which if he meets not with in a degree ſutable to his Deſire in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> He lives under, He preſently indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſubvert that <hi>Government</hi> out of hopes to meet with it in the next: Which is juſt as if the ſteele of which the Index of a Watch is compoſed ſhould refuſe to move out of a Diſcontent it was not imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Spring or Ballance; and at this rate I believe the ableſt Watch-maker would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of giving us a true movement. So that though it ſhould be allowed Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> that his <hi>Commonwealth</hi> has no Inequality in it, yet it would faile of attaining the perfection of <hi>Government,</hi> ſeeing there is an inequality in the Nature of Man, which is not rectifyed
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43887:99"/> by the Modell of his <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> What this Inequality conſiſts in, how far it is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Cure, and how Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> has failed of performing it, was the ſubject of my 8th and 9th Chapters, and therefore is not now to be repeated.</p>
            <p>I doe not intend to imploy my ſelfe in picking the Feathers off Mr <hi>Harrington's</hi> Cloake, or going in ſearch of the Inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Contradictions in the orders of his Modell; but I would be glad to know, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He be not unequall to Himſelf as well as the <hi>Nobility</hi> in ſuch orders as particularly concern them Having by his <hi>Agrarian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the <hi>Nobility</hi> (under which name I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo comprehend the Gentry of higher Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) unto the Condition of clypt Mony, He <note place="margin">Ocean. p. 25.</note> notwithſtanding appeares very ſolicitous They ſhould ſtill be currant, and not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in the uſes of the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> To This purpoſe diſtinguiſhes the whole people into <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Foot,</hi> making the <hi>Horſe</hi> to conſiſt of ſuch as have above one hundred pounds a yeare, and has provided that the <hi>Horſe</hi> ſhall have diverſe advantages as that (to omit the leſſer ones) the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>Great Magiſtrates</hi> ſhall conſiſt of Knights ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of their Number. But this favour to them is all this while but an handſome piece of Diſſimulation; For though there be care taken that at the Aſſembly of the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> and <hi>Tribe</hi> ſuch and ſuch <hi>Magiſtrates</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:43887:99"/> ſhall be elected out of the <hi>Horſe,</hi> there is no neceſſary proviſion there ſhould be any <hi>Horſe</hi> there, out of which to elect; For the Deputies at the <hi>Hundred</hi> and <hi>Tribe</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the Deputies elected at the <hi>Pariſh,</hi> It is a meer chance if in the <hi>Pariſh</hi> there were any <hi>Horſe</hi> at all elected: The Elector or Propoſer at the <hi>Pariſh</hi> are deſigned by the hap of drawing a Golden Ball out of the Urn, and theſe Electors or Propoſer nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the reſt of the Deputies to be propoſed to the <hi>Ballot,</hi> ſo that unleſs one of the <hi>Horſe</hi> chance to prove an Elector by drawing a Golden Ball, the nomination is wholly in the power of the <hi>Foot,</hi> who would be very ſenceleſs, by nominating any of the <hi>Horſe</hi> to part with that power which Fortune has put into their Hands. Now what ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability there is that any of the <hi>Horſe</hi> ſhould chance to draw a Golden Ball, will appeare by the great diſparity in number between the whole Body of the People and ſuch as may only be capable of being of the <hi>Horſe;</hi> It is confeſt by Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Nature of the <hi>Agrarian</hi> to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that the whole Land in <hi>Oceana</hi> may come into the hands of 5000 Men; But the <hi>Elders</hi> or Men capable of Election are confeſt to be 100000 Men; Wherefore the 5000 Men or the <hi>Horſe</hi> (though they ſhould as is moſt unprobable, be all of 30 yeares of Age and ſo Capable of <hi>Election)</hi> are but a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43887:100"/> twentieth part of Foot, and by Conſequence it is twenty to one that at every Election of the <hi>Pariſh</hi> not any of the <hi>Horſe</hi> come to be elected. By which it is evident there is a very great inequality in his <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> ſeing by the orders of it Matters may with great Probability be reduced to that paſs, That thoſe men who have the whole Propriety in Land may be wholly excluded from having any ſhare in the <hi>Government.</hi> It is apparent alſo, That the upper Roomes of his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,</hi> ſuch as are the <hi>Hundred, Tribe, Senate</hi> and <hi>Prerogative,</hi> are built upon a moſt ruinous Foundation, the Baſis of the <hi>Pariſhes</hi> being too weake to ſupport them, Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reduced the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> to 2000l. per an. and having deveſted them of all the Advantages of Birth and Deſcent, He leaves them alſo after all at the diſcretion of their good Neighbours with the High ſhoon, in reference to their whole intereſt in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for all this he has dealt more kindly with the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> then with the three Faculties of <hi>Divines, Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Phyſitians;</hi> For though the <hi>Ballance of Land,</hi> prove unprofitable to the <hi>Nobility,</hi> yet the <hi>Ballance of Beef</hi> remaies ſtill with them, And if againſt an Election Day they Feaſt my <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> handſomely, They may ſtill have hopes to be nominated by ſome of them; But the other are beyond all Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43887:100"/> of retriving it, excluded from having any ſhare in the <hi>Government;</hi> And that for this generall Reaſon, <hi>They who take upon them the Profeſsion of Theologie, Phyſick or Law, are not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ocean. p. 224</note> 
               <hi>at leiſure for the Eſſays whereby the Youth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence for all Magiſtracies, Offices and Honours in a Commonwealth.</hi> It ſeems that he who has under a ſtall imployed his Life in the Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of old ſhooes is qualifyed to fall to worke with the Breaches of the State; And he whoſe converſe has been nothing but whiſtling to Horſes, has a ſufficient Capacity to give Law to Mankind; But if any mans Education has been laid out in Purſuit of Truth and in a Familiarity with ſuch Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Notions &amp; Reaſons of Things, as tend to the advancement of Humane Nature, If He has afterward addicted himſelf in particular to ſuch Studies upon which depend the ſafety of every Man in private, and of ſociety in Common, That man muſt be depoſed from the Privelege of a Citizen, and forfeit that Liberty which is the Foundation of all <hi>Popular Government,</hi> That every Man ſhould concur to the making thoſe Lawes by which He is to be governed.</p>
            <p>The Clergy then or Divines will have Occaſion to make uſe of all the Patience and Humility they preach to others, in reference to their ſubmiſſion to a <hi>Government</hi> which treats them as People uncapable of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Privileges of Men; The Quality of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43887:101"/> Embaſſadours from Heaven which is uſually attributed to them ſeems to be underſtood litterally by Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> For He conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them as Aliens, and ſo denies them the Libertie due to all Engliſh Men; And he has made a little bold with the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> argument, by changing the Inference of it, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>They ſerve at the Altar,</hi> therefore they are to be uſed as Slaves and Helots.</p>
            <p>For the poore <hi>Phyſitians</hi> I leaſt of all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand why They ſhould be ſhut out from the <hi>Government</hi> whilſt their <hi>Apothecaries</hi> are admitted to it, And why the <hi>Farrier</hi> ſhould be made a better man then the <hi>Doctor.</hi> But there is no Help, They muſt be content to ſwallow this Pill, unleſs They can out of hand find Hellebore enough for our new Legiſlator.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> there is a particular reaſon why they ſhould have nothing to do with making of Lawes, becauſe it is enough for them that they can underſtand them when they are made; Yet there may be ſome cauſe to doubt, whether the whole Bench, and all the Innes of Court could find the way to underſtand ſuch Lawes as would be made by thoſe men who are themſelves obliged not to underſtand any. Howſoever Mr <hi>Harrington</hi> has that good perſwaſion of the whole profeſſion of <hi>Lawyers,</hi> that He thinks they would betray the Publique good, to the profit of their own Practiſe, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43887:101"/> therefore reſolves to baniſh them from all Intereſt in the <hi>Government;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Lawyers</hi> are in this, at leaſt, highly obliged to Him, That he has given them faire leiſure to turn their Books.</p>
            <p>Though every branch of theſe Orders be fertile of very dectructive Conſequences, I do not intend to proſecute any of them, but am Content in generall to obſerve, that the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> of <hi>Oceana</hi> which pretends ſo much to Equality, does wholly ſhut out the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of <hi>Divinity, Law,</hi> and <hi>Phyſick</hi> from any ſhare in the <hi>Government,</hi> and leaves the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> in a great probability of being reduced to the ſame Condition.</p>
